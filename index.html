            <h2> To The Gallows</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Fog… fog everywhere… fog obscuring her vision, dampening her lungs, gathering on the fine hairs of her neck and cheek. Fog assaulting her senses, distorting the hustle and bustle that surrounds her, and leaving the taste of salt and soot on her tongue.</p>

                <p>Birthed by the Atlantic, ferried by the Thames, fog shrouds the scene of Platform 9 ¾ like a somber veil.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione Granger finds herself suddenly struck with an affection for Charles Dickens; never before has she had any particular affinity for the lengthy prose detailing the dreary, oppressive fog as done so in <i>Bleak House</i>. Though now, for the first time, she fully comprehends its significance.</p>
            
                <p>The fog— thick and stagnant— looms eerily over the platform with a suffocating presence. Yet, this does little to hinder the bustling crowd; the platform is busier than ever. Families rush past, mothers chasing after their children with final attempts at nagging their young. Packs of students, donned in black robes scurry past, caught up in enthusiastic susurrations. Boys and girls lean out from the train windows shouting over the din, while parents look on- tears welling in their eyes.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione appears to be the only one taken captive by the thick fog which encapsulates the platform and the rain-soaked muck and grime which litters the stone. Though she intends to step forward, apprehension sets in, halting her. She could blame it on the onslaught to her senses—the overwhelming amalgamation of fog and commotion— that sends her into a state of paralysis. But in reality, it is the anxiety creeping up her spine and the ominous foreboding that such fog denotes.</p>
            
                <p>In her momentarily lapse of cognizance, she is shoved from behind.</p>
            
                <p>“Ger out the way!” Someone, somewhere yells. She thinks...</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is not quite sure and couldn't be bothered to care. The pounding in her head is making everything hazy and muddled. It's all too overwhelming. She begins to question whether her decision to return is a sensible one.</p>
            
                <p>She reminds herself: Deep breaths. One. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>In an attempt to calm her thoughts, she draws her attention to the skies, wherein she witnesses a most repugnant union: billows of heavy smoke loft from the smokestack of the train, mixing, fusing, and coagulating with droplets of rain, until all that meets earth is damp, mildewed soot.</p>
            
                <p>Definitely not helping.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's diverts her gaze, this time more frantically, searching for any distraction from the anxiety creeping its way under her skin.</p>
            
                <p>She focuses ahead, on a bundle of wet trunks stacked the height of three men. It leans precariously to the right, looming toward the ground like a melancholic Tower of Pisa. Directly beneath this impending doom, stands an old hag, who reaches up, and pinches the cheeks of a grown man. The hag is bent so far backward that it appears her spine may just snap in half. Hermione narrows her attention to the unfortunate man in her company.</p>
            
                <p>Neville?</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's unintended perusing catches his attention. His gaze snaps up, and his expression of raw concern sends her anxiety rocketing to new heights. Neville has always possessed an unusually abundant amount of nurturing instincts, tending to his friends as he does his plants. However, since the end of the war, his caring disposition has only seemed to intensify, making him insufferable company.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally rejoices at the fact that he is not close enough to witness her panic, and satisfies the situation by acknowledging him with a slight tip to her chin.</p>
            
                <p>Yes, Neville. All is well.</p>
            
                <p>Oblivious to her internal struggle, Neville offers a half-smile in return. However, his grandmother— the hag— seems to take notice of the gesture and twirls to face Hermione with unnatural speed. Her crimson spectacles slide a fraction lower on her nose as she unleashes a glare rivaling that of the entire ancestry of the Sacred 28. Duly noted. Perhaps Neville's Grandmother should be dispatched upon the arrival of the next dark lord, the glare alone would do.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione returns her attention to the train.</p>
            
                <p>One Breath. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>Without any warning, she suddenly breaks into panic. Fumbling for her beaded bag, she urgently pries it open.</p>
            
                <p>Where are they? Did she pack them? How did she forget? She has to go back. Just to check.</p>
            
                <p>In her mania, a gentle hand reaches out to grasp her arm, “Hermione.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry? What is it? I forgot something... Oh, bother. I need to go back, I forgot. I need-”</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, look at me,” he demands.</p>
            
                <p>His voice is calm and focused, but her hand does not relent its frantic rummaging through her bag. Suddenly, her fingers catch on a pouch and she sifts her fingers through the contents within.</p>
            
                <p>One. Two bottles. Yes, they're here.</p>
            
                <p>Her sigh of relief is palpable.</p>
            
                <p>“I knew you had what you were looking for. Take a breather, alright?”</p>
            
                <p>Finally, she looks up at Harry. His brows are furrowed, his gaze darting from her bag and then back to her face.</p>
            
                <p>Does he know?</p>
            
                <p>She banishes the thought, there is really nothing he can do. He's done enough. She allows her attention to zero in on what he can control, his soiled spectacles.</p>
            
                <p>Some things will never change.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione reaches up, removes them from his face, and taking the hem of her blouse between her fingertips, polishes them gently.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. You're right. It'll all be alright. I have everything I need, thank you.” She tries to put strength in her words, but they still sound weak.</p>
            
                <p>“I'm an owl away Hermione, don't forget it. You'll have Ginny, too. Ron and I wish you would stay, but I know the N.E.W.T.S., they're- erm, well I know how important they are to you. Ron and I will be here if you need anything... Please, just don't be a stranger, send an owl once in a while.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. Thanks, I will.” She offers a placating smile.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione wants to go on and say he should come too, that he needs to face it alongside her. He needs to find some kind of closure, Auror training will be there when they return. She wants to voice that Ron should be here too; that he should be with his friends, and needs something other than Firewhisky to help him cope.</p>
            
                <p>She wants to say that she's only going because she needs this. Maybe everything: all her anxiety, panic attacks, her addiction will end if she just faces the place where it all began. Her heart is aching to voice that if they can do this together like they always do, maybe everything will just be alright. They have a better chance together, they always have.</p>
            
                <p>Though, she doesn't say any of it. Instead, she places a small kiss to his cheek, pulls him into a hug, and makes her way toward the sound of the blowing whistle.</p>
            
                <p>Onwards, solider.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione peers over her shoulder one last time and notices Harry shifting on his feet nervously. His gaze is fixed on an empty bench, just to the right.</p>
            
                <p>“Harry... Go find Gin. Just-- don't leave without a goodbye. She doesn't deserve that...”</p>
            
                <p>Harry nods and his eyes look a bit clearer when he steps back from the train. Another nod, and he widens the distance between them. The motion marks the first moment the chasm divides them. Her heart aches in her chest. They stare at each other for another moment, until finally, Harry swiftly turns on his heels and rushes off to find Ginny. Hermione watches him depart, then, tucking a stray hair behind her ear, turns to face the carriage.</p>
            
                <p>Billowing smoke, soggy soot. Fog.</p>
            
                <p>Deep breaths. One, Two.</p>
            
                <p>One little step, another makes two. And up she goes, toward doom's impending beak.</p>
            
                <p>“So gently you came rapping,</p>
            
                <blockquote>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door”</blockquote>
            
                <p>The Raven, Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
            
                <p>On the train, the bustling sounds associated with imminent departure envelope the air. Trunks thud against panels, raucous hollering, and shrill laughter emanate from every direction as owls and familiars hoot and squeal over the din.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! A door shuts a few meters ahead.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! Two first-years giggle while tussling with a compartment door; opening and closing it repeatedly.</p>
            
                <p>It's too much.</p>
            
                <p>Further along the corridor, a playful quarrel erupts. A young boy wedges himself between a door, laughing uncontrollably, while a girl inside the compartment emits a playful shriek, trying to keep him out. The boy, donned in dress shoes, struggles to find traction on the wooden floor. He slips and slides on the polished wood, accidentally banging his foot against the wall panel- over and over again.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! More hollering. Screeching. Laughing.</p>
            
                <p>“Let me in Peggie!”</p>
            
                <p>Snickering. And cackling.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>“Little mud-blood”.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>In her haze, she scrambles for her wand, about to cast a hasty <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>, when jet-black hair catches the corner of her eye.</p>
            
                <p>No. It can't be.</p>
            
                <p>Then suddenly, two familiar eyes meet her own, for the second time that day. Neville. She's already aware he can see the mania plastered across her face, and there's no way she can hide it. With no other option, she turns on her heel and flees down the corridor in the opposite direction. In her haste, she accidentally runs into a young boy.</p>
            
                <p>“Sorry.” Their gazes lock briefly, she can tell the moment that it all clicks in his head, when he realizes he's just collided with the Hermione Granger. The reaction is always the same – eyes wide, mouth agape— it's maddening.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione!” Neville's voice cuts through the chaos. “Hermione, come back!”</p>
            
                <p>Without a second thought, she pushes past the boy and scrambles into the next train carriage. She doesn't look back once as she crosses the corridor into the third and then the fourth carriage. Finally, the overwhelming sounds begin to fade and discreetly slips into an empty compartment. Collapsing onto the bench, she lets out a heavy breath, and her hands reach up to cup her face. She inhales deeply. It's on the exhale when everything within her shatters. The sobs emerge. They convulse through her body, jerking her shoulder in erratic spasms. Her hands tremble as she holds her face, trying to suppress the wails she has no control over. Hermione slumps further into her hands. Three more sobs are all she allows.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>Gradually she lifts her chin and focuses on her measured, deep breaths.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>One last heavy sigh and she regains control of herself. She wipes her eyes, and nose, and collects the remnants of her tears with her sleeves. She heaves another glorious breath.</p>
            
                <p>Come off it, Hermione. You won a war for Goodrick's sake.</p>
            
                <p>There is a blaring of the whistle and a sudden jerk of the train as it shifts into motion. Hermione reaches into her beaded bag and locates the pouch she so treasures. Unfastening the clasp, she eyes the two vials: amitriptyline a muggle antidepressant, and diazepam. She has already taken her morning dose of both, but she needs another.</p>
            
                <p>It's just all too much.</p>
            
                <p>She discreetly slips a pill into her palm and gathers enough saliva for a swallow. Just as she raises her hand to her mouth and tilts her head back to swallow the pill, the compartment door jerks open. In a swift movement, she swallows sharply, forcing the pill down. Down. Hastily, she fumbles the lid back onto the vial and stows the evidence back into her beaded bag. Hermione stares at the ground for a few moments, until finally she tucks her hair behind her ear and raises her eyes to the intruder.</p>
            
                <p>“Well Hello, Granger”</p>
            
                <p>“Nott”</p>
            
                <p>Theodore Nott's lanky figure is angled languidly against the doorframe. His robes are pristine, tailored perfectly to his form. His hair coils around his face, framing it with a messy, tousled look. Full lips quirk menacingly as he gazes at her with a sardonic twinkle in his brown eyes.</p>
            
                <p>“My, my Granger. What do we have here?”</p>
            
                <p>“Carry on, Nott this compartment is full.” His eyes glint with mischief.</p>
            
                <p>“And I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be selfless... Although, I suppose Athena has paid the price for an entire compartment to herself.”</p>
            
                <p>“Actually, Gryffindors are known for our boldness and loyalty, something I suppose, a self-seeking Slytherin would hardly understand...Wait, did you just liken me to Athena?</p>
            
                <p>“Right, snappish, little Goddess! Allegedly, Athena emerged from the forehead of Zeus. Makes a bloke wonder... Pray tell, little Goddess, did you pop right out from the chosen one? It would explain the scar.”</p>
            
                <p>He quirks a lazy, half-smirk, and listlessly taps his forehead, referencing Harry's scar. Rolling her eyes, Hermione decides to ignore him. He WILL leave soon enough. A shuffle down the corridor gains his attention, and he slides covertly into HER compartment and locks the door behind him.</p>
            
                <p>At this, Hermione's heart stammers, “What are you doing?”</p>
            
                <p>“Calm Athena. I have no wish to incite your wrath. I'm avoiding a particular individual, at the moment.” His tone is indifferent, but when a passing figure in the hall produces a shadow behind the fogged glass window, he immediately stiffens.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione snorts, “Oh, I see. You are hiding. You know, a little Gryffindor courage might do you some good.”</p>
            
                <p>“Semantics, you pedant. And why would I need courage when I am perfectly capable of the much superior trait, self-preservation.”</p>
            
                <p>In another time, far from the present, this may have caused Hermione to seethe and rage. She might have created a cacophony of indignant huffs and high-pitched gasps. But alas, 'twas the present. Her mind was very far, her cares were not one, and valor was dead.</p>
            
                <p>“Hm.”</p>
            
                <p>Nott curiously quirks his head to the side. Then, in a quite audacious move, he rises, strides to the bench across from her, and primly seats himself.</p>
            
                <p>Heaven's. Go Away.</p>
            
                <p>“'Hm?' That's all you afford to the depraved masses? What in Merlin's name did you do with Hermione Granger? I am owed a retort, I demand it! I've heard too much praise, too many alluring tales of hexes, dragons, and all the likes of crossing the formidable Hermione Granger.”</p>
            
                <p>With an eye roll, she huffs again, “Let them eat cake.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh my queen, you wound me!” The twinkle in his eye has become a flaming, massive, wicked thing. He grasps at his heart with faux adoration.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well, I'm glad you're versed in muggle politics. This conversation has been riveting, nevertheless, that's all the time I've laid aside for you. Now, I really must get back to reading my book.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh reading, yes, that is what I walked into.” Her eyes grow wide. His no longer twinkle, they are the blazing Sun.</p>
            
                <p>“Quite the sneak you are, Theodore. Wouldn't want others to think you're a creep, barging in on women like that. Some would question your propriety and all that nonsense you people fuss over.”</p>
            
                <p>He huffs a laugh, “Propriety, dear God, are you my governess? I haven't concerned myself with such drivel since my twelfth birthday when my father insisted that flogging one's offspring produces a 'good heir' and an 'indomitable character'. Never, have I ever, concerned myself with those prospects nor propriety, since.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is overcome with anguish. Nott Sr. was a death eater, yes. There were whispers of his cruelty, yes. Though, weren't all Death Eaters cruel? Yet, flogging his son? And at twelve years old for that matter? The Man was a sadist, on par with Bellatrix herself. To be the son of such a man? Oh, poor Theodore. Everything is so fucked up. Hermione doesn't respond, she doesn't know how.</p>
            
                <p>Thankfully, he breaks the silence, and waves his hand in a dramatic flourish, “Please, spare me your pity. I haven't concerned myself with that since twelve as well”, quirking another smile he continues, “What I would like to concern myself with is what you were doing when I came in.”</p>
            
                <p>Begone anguish for thee, irritation hath returneth to me.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well. Vitamins.” Her gaze meets anything other than his own. There is a chip on the wooden trunk rack above his head, it is shaped like a pear. Odd.</p>
            
                <p>“Vit-amins. Hm. And those are?”</p>
            
                <p>“Micronutrients and the like, necessary for proper body functions and all. Very helpful... Very-- muggle. Wouldn't do you any good to concern yourself...”</p>
            
                <p>Theo seems to ruminate on this. “Hmmm... Proper body functions... Should I be taking these things you call -- Vit-amins?”</p>
            
                <p>“No,no don't bother. I am sure all your meals are well stocked with the necessary nutrients. I partake in muggle habits, so you know…” She trails off. Demeaning muggle eating habits? What was she thinking?? Her brain is foggy, she is disoriented, and the medication is kicking in...AND THEODORE NOTT NEEDS TO GET OUT.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT. If she willed it, would it be enough to just, happen?</p>
            
                <p>She finally peeks a glance at Nott, noting something indiscernible in his eyes... Suspicion?</p>
            
                <p>“It's not me to pry... I take on the personal philosophy of 'live and let live' or 'to each their own'.” Theo offers another wry smile, “However... I find it difficult to turn my attention away from people who share in the same pleasures as myself... So tell me, Goddess, most wise. What is in the vials?”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly, Hermione feels naked, exposed... Shit.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, we all dibble and dabble. We all do what we need to to get through.” He leans back in his seat and crosses an ankle over his knee. “It's only that I find joy in the art of discovering what exactly works for everyone. Call me voyeuristic of sorts.”</p>
            
                <p>“You are most definitely using that word wrong, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>“All the same, I'm interested in how you are coping, Hermione. And... If you ever need anything... Stronger, don't hesitate to ask.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione considers this, he very well could be of use. Perhaps. Until then, he will sit in her mind's corner of dusty, dark, and mysterious objects that may or may not- be useful. “Yes. Well, thank you for the gracious offer, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly the compartment door slides open again and Hermione silently curses the Pantheon of Greek Gods responsible. She reluctantly looks up to see who it is this time, and scowling his most infamous scowl, looms Draco Malfoy. Hermione immediately stiffens. His eyes are molten steel and there is not a single emotion betraying his cool exterior. Letting her gaze flit down his body she notices that he's grown. He's taller now. Where Nott is lanky and languid, Malfoy is all steel and stiff posture. Almost inhuman. Hermione shivers at the thought. With a fleeting nod to her, he turns and directs his full attention on Theo.</p>
            
                <p>“Theo, what the fuck? I've been scouring the whole bloody train looking for you. All five carriages.”</p>
            
                <p>Theo, ostensibly compliant with his capture, nods dramatically. “Yes, yes. Oh, Ancient Ruins, how will we ever get ahead if we don't read your family's entire private compendium on the matter, before leaving the sodding station.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally swoons. “Pri- Private compendium? On runes?” Her eyes are twinkling, she can't help. Someone help.</p>
            
                <p>Theo rises with an eye roll to rival the ages, “Great, Draco the trunks are already waterlogged as it is, no need to go about drenching their owners with your… Compendiums.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is a color. Hello world, I am Red. Draco's face betrays no emotion. Not even the twitch of a muscle. Is he stone? Hi, stone I'm Red. May I take a glance at your compendium? Just a peak? Damn pills. She was losing it.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT!</p>
            
                <p>“It was nice, not knowing you Nott. But, now I do. So erm- till next time, I suppose...” Or hopefully Nott. She wants to say it, but overkill.</p>
            
                <p>“It was lovely, little Goddess. Glad to see there's still some fire in there. Remember my offer." He offers a final parting smirk and wink, before striding past Malfoy and out of the compartment.</p>
            
                <p>Finally.</p>
            
                <p>However, Malfoy lingers. It's completely silent for a few moments, and Hermione's heart begins pounding in her chest. Is he going to hurt me? Kill me? She can't stop her incessant thoughts, so when he finally turns to face her she flinches. His steel-grey eyes meet hers, a palpable force that pins her to her seat.</p>
            
                <p>“Stay clear of Theo, Granger. He's my friend. Don't go ruining someone else's because you broke your own.”</p>
            
                <p>There's a swish of his robes, and the compartment door snaps shut.</p>
            
                <p>Prick.</p>
            
                <p>The sudden blow of long-awaited peace envelops her, she lies in a pool of numb tranquility.</p>
            
                <p>Bothered, who? Me? No, not ever again.</p>
            
                <p>I am color, I am rain, a Goddess whom from Zeus, I came.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione leans back, shifts her eyes closed, and allows herself to be claimed by a serene and dreamless sleep.</p>

            <h2> The Pheonix</h2>
            <div>
<p>The blaring of the train's whistle jolts Hermione from sleep. Spasms ricochet through her body on her ascent to consciousness, bringing about the slow return of sensation to her fingers and legs. Appendages accounted for, she goes about the painstaking task of prying her eyes open. A blur of mahogany comes into view and with it, the realization that her gaze is fixed heavenwards, to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Brain is mush, legs are lead, where is her neck? Slowly, oh so slowly, she begins to peel her spine from the upholstered bench. Finally, a creaky neck is accounted for among a mass of rickety bones. She reaches her hand to the back of her head and tentatively fingers the state of affairs. A ball of, something, is wedged behind her neck. And oh, God it's her hair. It's ..damp. Sigh.</p>

<p>Winding up all her strength and Gryffindor courage, she takes in her surroundings.</p>

<p>Blur, why is it so blurry?</p>

<p>Yellow.</p>

<p>Bright, blinding yellow, the most offending color she has ever seen, is across from her.</p>

<p>Hermione gathers all her brain power to muster a squint. Focus eyes. Focus. Two great, lime-green circular orbs swim into view. Then, a head. White hair-correction, albino blonde hair juts out from, Something…</p>

<p>Is that a cycling helmet?</p>

<p>There's only one logical answer to who exactly is sitting in front of her.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Luna.”</p>

<p>“Hi, Hermione”</p>

<p>“Luna? Erm- well, what are you wearing?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Luna glances down at herself. “My raincoat. Quite a pleasant color, wouldn't you agree?”</p>

<p>Luna's eyes are still coveted by orbs, nevertheless, Hermione still pictures them twinkling.</p>

<p>“No Luna. On your head, your eyes...”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Silly me, these are my Spectrespecs. I've redesigned them, you see.” With a dainty fist, she knocks the white surface of the helmet. Once, twice. Thrice. “Complete and total Wrackspurt protection.”</p>

<p>Hermione wills a small, pleasant nod.</p>

<p>“Your compartment is full of them. I think you've disturbed a colony. They seem to have taken a liking to your hair. I've been cataloging their movements whilst you slept. It's fascinating to analyze them in such a vulnerable state. They're usually quite guarded, but your hair seems to provide some sort of refuge.”</p>

<p>Merlin. Was that supposed to be a compliment? An involuntary curl pulls slightly on Hermione's upper lip. She allows it persist for only one, teensy moment, before she schools her features, and offers a small, strenuous smile.</p>

<p>“As always Luna, I've missed your insights.”</p>

<p>Luna seems unaffected and continues her observations.</p>

<p>To Hermione's relief, commotion from the hall brings about a means of escape.</p>

<p>“Yes, well... As always, I'm happy to be of use in any academic pursuit. Now, I think we should collect our things. It seems everyone is disembarking.”</p>

<p>In one swift motion, she moves to gather her outer robes, retrieves her beaded bag from the bench, and secures it tightly around her wrist.</p>

<p>A loud pop seizes her attention. Luna begins uncorking a bottle containing a suspicious, green substance and swiftly downs the contents, effectively wafting putrid smells into the small compartment. Luna looks to Hermione with a broad smile, her teeth are stained green. Green! Hermione is horrified to discover Luna nudging another unopened bottle into her hand.</p>

<p>“A gift. From father and I. We made five batches for my return to Hogwarts. I made one for everyone.”</p>

<p>With wary acquiescence, Hermione's fingers gingerly pinch the neck of the bottle, reluctantly taking it from the strange girl.</p>

<p>“My thanks to you and Xenophilius. Um, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Gurdyroot Elixir.”</p>

<p>Hermione wrangles a full-body squirm. She feels something escape, and her eye twitches.</p>

<p>“Tastes best warm, as tea, but you can drink it however you'd like. Helps to keep the Wrackspurts away. You'd do best to drink it at every meal, they seem to love your hair and bag..” She resumes her habit of trailing off again, turns, and slides out the compartment door.</p>

<p>Hermione peers at the bottle now in her possession. The stopper is crusty and slightly sticky. Unsure of how to approach this, she murmurs a quick reducio, shrinking the item to the size of her finger, and tucks it into a very far and seldom thought-of corner of her beaded bag. Without dwelling further on the matter, she follows after Luna.</p>

<p>Aside from herself and Luna, the train seems to be deserted. She breathes a sigh of relief. Hopefully, this means she won't have to encounter any familiar faces, and perhaps she'll even manage to slip off the train and make her way to the castle, completely unnoticed. The distant sounds of voices become apparent and she knows her hopes are dashed. Growing closer, discernible shouting fills the air. Two voices, female. One, high pitched and shrill. The other… authoritative, passionate, with a matter-of-fact tone…</p>

<p>Ginny.</p>

<p>With a rather rude shove past Luna, Hermione scrambles down the steps of the train to find Ginny and Tracie Davis standing less than a meter apart, both visibly seething.</p>

<p>Ginny is a portrait of fury, her eyes are alight with a fire completely harmonious with the scarlet of her waves. Her anger is palpable, filling the space around her and enveloping the air with her ruby essence. Her countenance seems to emanate, 'I am Genevra Weasley, do not dare tempt me.' The grip of her wand is fierce at her side, ready, but not aimed.</p>

<p>Davis, on the other hand, appears panicked. She gesticulates wildly, flinging her arms about in dramatic, frantic waves as if attempting to rally a mob to her cause. As if anyone would support her in her decision to go head-to-head with the formidable Ginevra Weasley.</p>

<p>Hermione steps forward, preparing herself. She must do something.</p>

<p>However, a hand appears on her shoulder and a broad chest blocks her approach. Looking up, she takes in Neville's concerned gaze. He's wearing those blasted worried eyes again, which Hermione thinks, is rather exasperating. With a gentle push of his palm, he guides her back to where Luna and Parvati now stand and offers an explanation, “Tracie accused Ginny of attempting to shove Pucey down the train steps.”</p>

<p>Parvati interjects with pointed enthusiasm, “Now she's defending her boyfriend's honor by challenging Ginny to a duel.”</p>

<p>Hermione does not school her features as her mouth falls agape, “That's unbelievable, Ginny would thrash her.”</p>

<p>Neville laughs knowingly, “Yeah well, Davis is willing to take the fall for her boyfriend. Pucey plays seeker, as does Ginny. There's only one team for the seventh and eighth years, inter-house unity and all..”</p>

<p>Yet again, Hermione is taken aback, “Inter-house unity?”</p>

<p>Parvati, giddy with gossip, interjects once more in a low, conspiratorial tone, “There are whispers of a single Quidditch team for returning seventh and eighth years. Not sure of the specifics, but everyone's going on about it. Each house is trying to find a way to ensure their players have a spot on the team. So..” Pavarti motions toward the girls still arguing, “If you're caught dueling you're sacked from the team. Davis is trying to rid Ginny of her chance at becoming Seeker.”</p>

<p>Well, that explains...</p>

<p>With a renewed sense of purpose, Hermione sidesteps Neville and strides confidently up to Davis, “Ahem, Davis. Since you've taken it upon yourself to defend your boyfriend's honor, I'd like to be Ginny's representative. Ready your wand, I haven't got all night."</p>

<p>Tracie steps backward, apprehension etching her features. She resumes her flailing gestures toward Ginny, "But... It's her! I called her to a duel!"</p>

<p>Hermione's eye roll is practically audible. Rain begins to pour, yet she stands her ground, obstinate.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all aware you're here on behalf of Pucey. Now, I've come on behalf of Ginny, so stop wringing her out, take up your wand, and focus on how you'll go about dueling me."</p>

<p>Draco stands motionless in the wet, squelching mud. His trousers and the hem of his robes are covered in thick grime. Rainwater trickles from the strands of his hair in delicate beads, tracing the gaunt lines of his cheekbones, pooling together to ricochet off his jaw in rivulets. He is transfixed by the cloudy-white eyes before him. With a huff, steam erupts from two bony nostrils, the force parting his hair back from his eyes.</p>

<p>Eyes, which, two years ago, could not perceive the creature in front of him.</p>

<p>Eyes, once faultless.</p>

<p>Eyes, now tarnished, from what he had witnessed, By what he had done.</p>

<p>A soft nudge at his arm derails him from his stupor. He finds Theo standing next to him. Wet, brown, mousy fringe is plastered about his forehead while he stares blankly at the creature before them both. “Everyone sees them now mate. Everyone.”</p>

<p>Draco swallows and nods.</p>

<p>“Come on now, time to join the others..”</p>

<p>With one last nudge, Theo strides toward the carriage doors and climbs in.</p>

<p>Looking back into the eyes of the Thestral, Draco breathes deeply. If he were to peer long enough into the eyes of the creature, he would have seen each death, every pair of eyes lost to darkness in his presence.</p>

<p>So instead, he swiftly turns on his heel and stalks toward the carriage.</p>

<p>Draco slips into the shelter of the carriage and produces a silent drying charm with his wand. He settles onto the bench and glances up to find Theo sporting his most ostentatious smile, "I would recommend a Scourgify too, mate. Your hem is abysmal."</p>

<p>Less than a minute in the carriage and Draco can already feel irritation prickling under his skin, "Washing is the only acceptable possibility; charms thin the thread. By now, I'd expect you to comprehend these concepts, Theo. Your grandfather practically wrote that damned pureblood handbook that forced the knowledge of 'proper garment care' onto me as 'necessary education' for all of us miserable heirs. Had to learn that rubbish at seven, the most excruciatingly dull lessons, and I blame you."</p>

<p>Theo raises a brow.</p>

<p>"Pah! Oh yes, thread preservation. At the top of my priority list. And for your information, I never had to learn 'proper garment care.' Father said, and I quote, 'That's what elves are for, you Nit,' when the governess tried to teach it to me. Anyway, I'd rather roll with the swine than continue with the inbred concepts cherished by a certain Cantankerous Nott."</p>

<p>Draco narrows his eyes, "Trust me, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments. But why do you continue to treat me like I'm some shifty Overlord? Are you to be a tosser all year?"</p>

<p>Theo's retort is a bitter murmur, "If you keep keeping tabs on me like some kind of lost puppy, I just might."</p>

<p>Blaise lets out a snort, “And I thought Pansy was bad.”</p>

<p>Both Draco and Theo's eyes drift toward the woman tucked into the far corner of the carriage her face pressed against the window, showing no sign of having overheard. With a lurch forward the carriage departs, and all four passengers carry on in silence.</p>

<p>The Great Hall appears resplendent as if no war had taken place within these same stone walls. Glittering candles descend from the charmed roof and illuminate the scene above, storm clouds and rain. Floating instruments carry forth mellifluous hymns as if attempting to fabricate a state of serenity. Four familiar banners rest above each table, beckoning students to their place of refuge.</p>

<p>She allows her gaze to flit across the room and eyes the stretch of stone where Remus, Tonks, and Fred once lay prone, lifeless. It is plain, devoid of the death that once imbued this place, and it just feels wrong. Pausing, in an attempt to gather herself, she squeezes her eyes shut.</p>

<p>Get it together Hermione. Just get through tonight.</p>

<p>She allows one moment to pass before she opens them again and banishes the distressing thoughts. In her state of renewed clarity, she takes note of an unfamiliar table situated at the far end of the hall. It is set perpendicular to the other four tables, seemingly plain and lacking decorum. Odd.</p>

<p>There is a sudden prod to her right rib. She looks about warily and finds Dean falling into step beside her. Wonderful.</p>

<p>“Can't believe you almost dueled Tracie Davis, Hermione. You are a right lioness.”</p>

<p>“Meow,” comes Seamus Finnegan now on her left flank.</p>

<p>Rolling her eyes for what seems like the umpteenth time, she realises belatedly this habit is going to persist ad nauseam.</p>

<p>She attempts ignorance and finds a place amongst the Gryffindor table. Ginny and Neville take positions on either side of her, enclosing her as if she is a flighty fledgling attempting to flee the nest.</p>

<p>Seamus and Dean settle opposite from them, and Seamus prattles on, “That Davis is a right pillock, shoulda done it, Hermione. Shoulda folded her body in two, stuffed her into a trunk, and sent her right back to the station.”</p>

<p>Ginny turns toward Hermione with a clear and intense expression, “We can't have you gallivanting the countryside going about defending my honour. I love you Hermione, and I would've been pleased to see Davis's head coming out her arse, but I'm really glad you didn't go after her.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small shrug, “I wasn't actually going to hex her.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know that. I'm just glad to have you on my side.”</p>

<p>Both girls exchange a small smile. Ginny discreetly clasps Hermione's hand under the table, giving it a tight squeeze.</p>

<p>A voice booms throughout the hall, ending their heart-to-heart, “STUDENTS! ATTENTION!”</p>

<p>All eyes lift toward the podium where Hagrid towers, seemingly surprised by his shocking cadence. He reddens and steps aside. McGonagall gives him a slight nod and approaches the podium.</p>

<p>She is draped in violet robes with a trail of morning glories adorning her hem. Keen eyes settled behind dainty spectacles scan the throng of students. Her eyes briefly land on Hermione's before flittering away. She lifts her chin and begins,</p>

<p>“I am gracious to be standing amongst you all tonight. We have been through many hardships in the course of the last few years. Many of you have faced trials that no witch or wizard, let alone children, should ever have had to endure. I do not say this lightly, I am most proud of my students here at Hogwarts. We will not ignore all that has happened; Our triumph over darkness was not without its many terrible losses. And for those, we mourn.”</p>

<p>McGonagall bows her head in respect for a few moments before proceeding,</p>

<p>“We have gathered here, in the castle that in many ways, sent each of you in directions imposed on you by your parents, your elders. Today we stand together once more. You, dear students, are the future of the Wizarding World. You now have a choice, a decision to shape it according to your vision. I am incredibly proud of every student who has chosen to join me and all our dedicated professors in returning to Hogwarts. This year will be marked by understanding, progress, and unity. Hereby, I would like to introduce a novel and transient house, a house whose namesake is inspired by our most noble headmasters: Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Both wizards were vital to the war's outcome, sacrificing their reputations and lives for righteousness. This house erected in their honour, will be comprised of seventh years and those returning for their eighth year. It will be known as the House of the Phoenix. From ashes, you will rise, and death shall not be proud, for you all have conquered.”</p>

<p>She gestures to the back of the hall, to the odd table placed perpendicular to the others. From above, a banner descends gracefully, its fabric rippling to unveil a flaming gold Phoenix set against a backdrop of deep violet. Atop the table, a runner appears adorned in the same violet hue, intricately embroidered with gold, it shimmers against the dark wooden surface.</p>

<p>McGonagall outstretches her arm toward the opulent display, “Students please welcome, the House of Phoenix.”</p>

<p>Stillness sweeps over the Great Hall like a seismic wave. Hermione is knocked from level ground and plunged into the abyss. Her ears are ringing amidst the piercing silence. What is happening? Amidst her disorientation, she vaguely hears Professor McGonagall continue,</p>

<p>“I would now ask that all seventh years and returning eighth years rise from their previous houses and conjoin at your new house table.”</p>

<p>Not one person stirs in response. Hermione is still plunging: down, down, down. The ringing in her head multiples. Instinctively her hand twitches toward her beaded bag.</p>

<p>Too much. This is too much. Why couldn't we have a normal year, for once?</p>

<p>The moment persists for an eternity. A “bloody ridiculous” emanates from somewhere, Hermione immediately thinks, Slytherin. At last, movement stirs to Hermione's right.</p>

<p>Neville rises, swings his leg over the bench, and strides purposefully toward the back table. Seconds pass, and then another figure emerges from Hufflepuff. Luna Lovegood breezes down the aisle toward the back table. Following her lead is Lavender Brown, her appearance notably disheveled compared to previous years and Parvati trails her from behind. Next, three from Ravenclaw: Cho Chang, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Padma. Michael Corner follows suit.</p>

<p>Across the table from her, Dean and Seamus exchange glances before shrugging and joining in the procession. Soon it is a flurry of movement as every seventh and eighth year convene at the back table. The only remaining Gryffindor's are Hermione and Ginny.</p>

<p>Hermione takes note that not one Slytherin has yet to make a move as well. A nudge to her side waylays her thoughts and she makes eye contact with the fiery redhead at her side,</p>

<p>“Come on Hermione, sod it.” And with that, Ginny rises and swaggers down the aisle.</p>

<p>Hermione glances toward the podium again and is met with those keen eyes and a highly arched, expecting brow.</p>

<p>Sod it. Sod it. Sod it ALL.</p>

<p>Swinging her leg over the bench she aims her gaze at an empty stretch of seating near the end. She avoids the many eyes set on her, approaches the table and awkwardly lowers herself onto the bench.</p>

<p>To everyone's surprise and enunciated by several audible gasps, Pansy Parkinson is the first to rise from Slytherin. Head down She rushes toward the Phoenix table. Blaise Zabini jumps up and strides after her. Then Slytherin after Slytherin rises, albeit begrudgingly, until the only remaining eighth years are Nott and Malfoy.</p>

<p>Finally, Theo raises his arms in an arching stretch and proceeds to climb from the Slytherin bench.</p>

<p>In the strain of the silence Malfoy drawls, “Et tu, Brute?”, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Theo turns to Malfoy and shrugs, “Slytherin has done shite for me.”</p>

<p>With that, he pads toward the Phoenix table.</p>

<p>Hermione currently finds her place setting quite riveting. She does not take notice of the two menacing brown eyes currently drilling holes in the back of her head.</p>

<p>Something within her squirms the moment she senses a familiar impetuous presence behind her. Turning, she finds Theo and his damned smirk. His tousled waves fall about his forehead and he shakes his head like a wet dog.</p>

<p>“Hello again, little Goddess. Mind if I take a seat next to my new favorite housemate?”</p>

<p>Hermione summons her most sardonic grin, preparing her quip, only to be spared from such glories by none other than Malfoy. Theodore is utterly unprepared to defend himself against the book that comes hurtling at his head, resulting in a loud thud upon contact with his 'impeccable' hair. Malfoy, the truculent menace, (or saviour?) begins hauling him by the shoulder toward the other end of the table, where the other Slytherins now cluster together like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>McGonagall carries on, “Thank you all for your cooperation. Now, let us commence forth with the sorting of the first years!” With that McGonagall carries on with the usual Hogwarts welcome back customs."</p>

<p>Hermione, along with the rest of the Phoenix, seems disinterested in such frivolities. The entire table sits in silence throughout the sorting ceremony, the performance of the Hogwarts song, and the feast. Staring down at the untouched green pudding in front of her, Hermione is suddenly interrupted by a loud, throaty cough.</p>

<p>All heads swivel to the far end of the table, where she once sat in solitude. Following the many gazes with her own, she beholds a peculiar elderly man standing just to the right of her. He wears round, oversized spectacles, which make his green sparkling eyes appear two times larger than what is normally considered 'proportionally pleasing'. His spectacles perch on a long, pointy nose just above a sparsely mustachioed lip, slightly shaven on the left, revealing a large, dull mole. He hunches over a cane, teetering dangerously to the side, his bald head reflecting light like a beacon, causing Hermione to wince, the glare piercing the back of her eyelids.</p>

<p>Despite his kind and bright eyes, there's a sense of mischief about him. He coughs his last, producing a hacking and painful sound, and speaks in a rickety voice, “House of Phoenix students, follow me to your dormitory.” With that, he turns swiftly and skips out of the hall.</p>

<p>Hermione exchanges a glance with Ginny down the table, receiving a gleam of excitement in return.</p>

<p>Everyone hurries after the old man, catching up to him on the staircase where he leans over his cane, heaving great gulping breaths. His pace now snail-like, inches him forward at an excruciating rate. After a few moments, like a toy with a new cell, he skips off again. This pattern is repeated intermittently. Hermione finds the whole ordeal reminiscent of one of her favorite childhood tales, Aesop's Fable, 'The Tortoise and the Hare'. He is both Tortoise and Hare, simultaneously. Her mind drifts to Lord Dunsany's version of the tale, and she inwardly recites “a glorious victory for the forces of swiftness”, when he finally reaches the 7th floor.</p>

<p>The old man paces along the wall that previously housed the Room of Requirement, and to Hermione's dismay, appears to be attempting to conjure the door.</p>

<p>No. No. No.</p>

<p>Hermione is a deer, stunned, unmoving. Her mouth is parched. Her hands are clammy. Her voice cracks as she releases a mortifying shriek, “STOP!”</p>

<p>Turning slowly, the old man's eyes meet her own, questioningly.</p>

<p>She stutters, somewhat abashed at her nerve, “Um, you- you can't open it. It was destroyed… With fiendfyre.”</p>

<p>The only response and warning she receives is an impish wink. A door materializes behind him and he reaches for the shimmering handle, yanking it open. Hermione's heart stammers in her chest as she braces herself for the barrage of flames. However, to her surprise, none come. Instead, golden light drifts into the corridor, casting long shadows onto the walls behind the students, who stand peering at the open door, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>Hermione is shocked. How? How? How is this possible? She'd seen the flames herself. She felt the scorching ribbons brush her brow. She watched as Crabbe was swallowed whole by the inferno. How? She needs to know.</p>

<p>Another seems to be grappling with similar incredulity, “How?”</p>

<p>She turns, curious as to who produced the query, and finds Malfoy directly behind her, his jaw tight, eyes fixated on the door.</p>

<p>In response, the old man offers a toothy grin. “Fiendfyre: volatile, perilous, nearly impossible to be rid of. Yet, I know a secret” he pushes forward in a conspiratorial tone, “I've learned a strong Finite Incantatem does well enough in most cases.” Hermione's jaw falls off its hinge. There is no way...</p>

<p>Dismissing the unabashed gawking of the students, he carries on, “Without further ado, the Phoenix dormitories! Password is DoxyDung. I trust you will not go about chanting it in the corridors; might offend some rather prickly creatures.”</p>

<p>He gives another surreptitious wink and somehow his grin grows wider, “I am to be your head of house and strapping new, Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.” With this, he attempts a bow so low Hermione is afraid he might keel over.</p>

<p>“Professor NeatWanker at your service!”</p>

<p>Absolute silence. Everyone is afraid to dare breathe. To her right, Dean nudges Seamus with a whisper, “NeatWanker? Old geezer's setting himself up for a good ribbing.”</p>

<p>Seamus's left eye twitches, he looks tortured. His lips are pinched together, face reddening with the pass of each second.</p>

<p>Dean continues, “He's a literal wanker, Where'd they even find this codger? Went and Plucked him straight from the bloody tomb?”</p>

<p>Professor NeatWanker whirls his head towards Dean with exuberance, “Think I still got a few years left, wouldn't you say?” He demonstrates this by promptly breaking into a lively Irish step dance, using his cane to push himself off the ground at each arching leap.</p>

<p>Seamus the Tomato, erupts. His knee-slapping, elbow-jabbing, foot-trampling, and ear-splitting affairs claim several victims, including Hermione's foot.</p>

<p>Considering this most riveting performance and her freshly bruised toe, Hermione finds herself drained. She can't be bothered to handle any more unpredicted happenings for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Belatedly, the students file into the dormitory and find themselves welcomed by a large room lit by candlelight, with vast couches adorning the center of the room in front of a roaring hearth. Each side of the hearth is lined by two staircases, which Hermione surmises, lead to the boys' and girls' dormitories. Without hesitation, she presses onward, climbing the staircase situated to the right. Arriving at the top, she casts her gaze over the row of doors. A surge of relief floods through her when she spots her name shimmering, charmed to glitter in her presence, upon one of them. With a steady hand, she grasps the doorknob and pushes open the door to refuge.</p>

            <h2> Hence, These Tears</h2>
            <div>
<p>The reflection in the mirror has become far too familiar: hallowed cheeks, dull, lifeless eyes, and purple bags. Lips that pull slightly downward reveal a perpetual frown.</p>

<p>Impassive, soulless, a shell of his former self.</p>

<p>Draco observes himself through the one-way window of his mind. He assesses the image clinically, he should take better care of his appearance. He must convey composure, even if it feels futile. Anyone could be watching. He knows they lie in wait for the moment he falters, cracks. The moment he loses his shit or whatever it is they expect from him. He needs to stay vigilant.</p>

<p>He recalls Robards, practically salivating during the hearing, eager to drag him to Azkaban like he did his father. However, Draco was unyielding, he gave them nothing, not a twitch. When the allegations were presented, he stood there, chained to the floor like the disobedient dog they were itching to make of him. They wanted him to cower, to beg. He gave no contest to his culpability. Fixating his eyes on the Wizengamot and staring them down, he silently declared, 'I don't give a damn about what you do with me'. He was ready for his fate and had accepted it. That is, until Potter and Granger turned up, delivering their ludicrous testimonies, portraying him as some sad and helpless whelp, dubbing him a 'misguided youth' who had been under duress.</p>

<p>After days of interrogation and contentious debates, those two stalked into the courtroom, and like clockwork, he was acquitted the same day, albeit with just a year of academic probation. The defense, from two of the “Golden Trio”, made him look pathetic. Rita published that damn article, insinuating he'd paid them off. Fucking twat. Like he'd be so desperate.</p>

<p><i>Calm down.</i></p>

<p>He reminds himself that this is exactly why he has to stay behind the safe walls of his Occlumency. His father's shame. That scornful drawl echoes through his mind: “You're too emotional, boy”, “You'll always be soft” and “Your passions are disgraceful, restrain yourself, Draco”.</p>

<p>An eye in the mirror twitches.</p>

<p><i>Why does it always come back to him?</i></p>

<p><i>Stop.</i></p>

<p>He re-centers himself.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year. A chant, a Prayer.</i></p>

<p>After this, he's leaving the continent. He's taking everyone he has left: Mother and Theo. This is the goal, the only thing that's keeping him from falling apart. His grip tightens on the edge of the sink and he leans down. His mind drifting towards her… Mother… Mother who is wasting away in the manor, biding her time in house arrest, staring out the large windows of the conservatory, surrounded by countless acres, utterly alone.</p>

<p>The walls crumble.</p>

<p>Draco eyes the reflection in the mirror, and the tears begin to cascade, streaking down his gaunt cheeks. His mind drifts away…</p>

<p>Tears, from a different time streaming, warm arms cradling him tightly, his head wedged in the crook of a neck…</p>

<p>Father had gone 'on business”. It was always a vague, brief declaration, Draco pondered it a few times, Father didn't have a job, had he? At any rate, he was Lord Lucius Malfoy, so Draco troubled himself no further.</p>

<p>It was spring, Mother approved his plea of having breakfast on the terrace in the east wing. He munched on bacon and observed the battle of winter and spring: Cold air wound up his legs, nipping at him ferociously, erupting goosebumps in its wake. Then, sunlight erupted like a warrior lying in wait, piercing the cold with his bronze grip. The war raged on… Draco chewed on, laughing and steeped in wonderment.</p>

<p>When father was away, he was permitted to wear whatever he so desired, and he always opted for play clothes. They made him feel free. He slid down the banisters in his loose shorts, snuck into the elves' chambers with dusty sleeves, rolled down the grassy hills with wild hair, and chased the peacocks in worn trainers. He was liberated, he could breathe.</p>

<p>Despite his mother's coddling and leniency, he couldn't help his diminishing behavior. He had his tantrums, became reckless, and sought out trouble. He couldn't help it. The available air was overwhelming, it was exhilarating, it was sublime. Father would return, and it would end. Thinking of it made him anxious, so he grabbed at anything he could and held on for dear life.</p>

<p>After his bacon-exclusive meal, he climbed the manor walls, clinging to the lattice and vines. The leaves scratched at his bare arms as he lugged his broom up with him; The broom, his mother referred to as being, 'twice his size', but to Draco's glee, father had insisted he have. He hadn't actually flown it yet, it was too big and hefty. It wouldn't take off the ground, or at least not from the ground, he reasoned. Thus, he was standing on the roof, over the east tower, with the broom between his legs. He could see his untouched porridge on the terrace below, by now, likely cold and thickened. He peered into the distance, at the mist rising from the lake's surface from the warm rays of sunlight. He wanted to brush against it, to twirl the mist in his fingertips.</p>

<p>He held onto that thought and leapt.</p>

<p>The spiral downward made his stomach swoop, the bacon was back in his throat. He jerked the broom, up, up, up. It complied for a moment before dipping again. The war between boy and broom, spring and winter, freedom and captivity, raged on as always. Finally, broom met tree and his grip slipped. He plunged through the branches which seemed to reach for him, only slightly slowing his descent. At last, his back hit the ground. His leg, dawned in his play shorts made a sharp snap. A cry reverberated through him. With a small pop, Dobby was there, gathering him and muttering something akin to, “Oh master Draco, Dobby is so sorry. Dobby will take you to Mistress.”</p>

<p>He was placed in warm arms. Tears streaked down his cheeks, wails and hiccuping came forth from his lips. Dobby healed his leg, Though, his cries still carried on.</p>

<p>Still cradled in soft arms, he was rocked soothingly, “Shh, my love. My sweet, daring child. You are so brave, so valiant.” She swayed with him for long, countless moments. Eventually, he ceased his cries and met her eyes.</p>

<p>“There he is. My perfect boy. I have you now. All is well.” In his mother's arms, Draco could breathe. She rocked him until his head found its place in her neck, until his eyes fluttered close.</p>

<p>That night, father returned early, and with him, his reckoning. Play clothes were banished, broom met <i>incendio</i>, Dobby was beaten. And of Draco's punishment, father never left again.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year.</i></p>

<p>Pounding at the bathroom door startles him to his senses. He straightens and stiffens. Tears cease, eyes tighten, and walls rise once more.</p>

<p>“On with it! Take the piss already! No use just staring at it! You've been in there for ages, Draco! Unless.. It's not a piss you're taking... You know what, never mind, I'll use the common room loo, you constipated Bowtruckle.”</p>

<p>Five in the morning and the prat is awake. Draco whirls, ripping open the door.</p>

<p>“Why, in Merlin's name are you awake? I purposefully woke at five in the bloody morning as to avoid your ghastly voice.”</p>

<p>“Hush I know you're cranky, Draco but you know you love me, I'm irresistible.”</p>

<p>“Please, piss off. You're growing intolerable. I might just leave you behind when I'm through with this place.”</p>

<p>Draco pads to his bed to retrieve his satchel, heads toward the door and walks briskly out. As he heads down the stairs, Theo follows.</p>

<p>“You know you wouldn't do that. Then I'd be all alone. I'd probably become some kind of mobster, making deals with vampires and that sort. I'm too much like my father when I'm lonely... Who is going to take care of me? I can't bear to think of it. Growing old in that cold, dank manor, with spiderwebs in my sock drawer, sporting long fingernails and crusty lips. Eugh... If that ever is my fate, please just kill me.”</p>

<p>They reach the common room and pause. Sitting on a sofa in the far corner is Lavender Brown. She sports a high turtleneck and is staring out a

 window, seemingly unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>Theo whispers none too discreetly, “Shite, thought she was dead.”</p>

<p>He makes a gesture with his hand feigning slicing his throat, his eyes move to the back of his head and his tongue, slackened, spills out of his unhinged jaw.</p>

<p>Immediately, Brown whips her head around to face the two. Fortunately, Theo does seem to have a wit stashed deep under that thick head of his. He collects himself, turns back to Draco, and begins loudly proclaiming, “Bread, Draco! I need bread! Silly nutter, you. Itchy throat, remember? Does the trick. Ah, I've gotta go, to-erm.. take that piss I was telling you about... Yea, okay see you, bye…”</p>

<p>Loud thumping is followed as Theo dashes back up the stairs. Draco simply turns and continues toward the exit.</p>

<p>He thinks he'll head to the library, just to study a bit, and prepare. Then, he'll grab a quick breakfast from the Great Hall, he needs to pack some meat back on his bones and fill out the gauntness. Then, off to potions. It's a good plan. Solid.</p>

<p>Hand on the door, he turns and eyes the back of Lavender Brown's head, she's still sitting on the couch, facing the window. He looks through it too, the sun is new in the sky, and rays stream down onto the landscape below. The lake lies peacefully still and mist billows from its surface.</p>

<p>On second thought, maybe he'll take a ride on his broom. After all, he's already donning his leisure wear under his robes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first day of classes and she's late. Never has Hermione Jean Granger been late for anything. Taking two steps at a time, she rushes down the stairs to the dungeons for potions. A loud growl reverberates through her, causing her to momentarily teeter on a step. God, it's her stomach. Disturbed, she points her wand at the responsible organ and mutters a <i>silencio</i>.</p>

<p>Having missed out on breakfast, she's famished. And now she realizes she had scarcely eaten anything the evening before either. Frizzy hair whips into her eyes. She had no time to plait it. Her robes are wrinkled and askew, and she didn't even have a moment to brush her teeth. She quickly whips out her wand in her descent and performs a quick <i>Scourgify</i> on her mouth. It stings slightly and leaves a residual feeling of uncleanliness, but at least her breath won't reek.</p>

<p>How, how did she let this happen?</p>

<p>Memories of the previous evening are in shards and pieces. She remembers finding her room, claiming a bed, healing her foot, and pulling the canopy curtains closed. The rest is fuzzy.</p>

<p>Fragments rise: in her search for the balm, she discovered a vial of Draft of Peace at the bottom of her bag. Probably from her last medical run while camping with Harry and Ron. She needs to find a moment to clean it out. She's still carrying that damned tent, too. She had taken the draught and then her medications. Shit she had taken both. She remembers floating in a pool of bliss, staring at the canopy ceiling. She was cocooned, safe.</p>

<p>Shit. She was high as a bloody kite.</p>

<p>Her mind is racing as she slips into class. Everyone is standing, lined around the room as Slughorn makes his announcements, thankfully he doesn't seem to notice her slipping in late.</p>

<p>“…Having said that, when you're seated please join your partner in prepping your ingredients for our first potion, sleeping draught.”</p>

<p>Hermione leans in towards Padma, whom she had squeezed in next to upon entering.</p>

<p>“What's going on?”</p>

<p>Padma eyes her suspiciously and then seems to think better of it, whispering, “Well, Slughorn has seating assignments for potions this year.”</p>

<p>“What? Why would he do that?"</p>

<p>“He said it was due to the inter-house unity initiative, McGonagall is taking it all very seriously.”</p>

<p>Padma's name is called then and Slughorn has her take a seat next to Blaise Zabini. Slughorn continues.</p>

<p>“Pansy Parkinson, Neville Longbottom, right here next to the cabinets. Don't let anyone go about taking anything without using the inventory system. Hogwarts does not have endless resources, students! However, if you or your families would like to donate to our potion stores, please see me after class. A wonderful opportunity for academic endorsement! Now where were we? Oh, yes! Luna Lovegood, Draco Malfoy here…”</p>

<p>He carries on and Hermione's mind drifts towards the previous night again. Mixing Draft of Peace and her medications seemed to produce a heightened sense of euphoria, One she had never experienced before. Moonstone, Hellebore, Mandrake, Unicorn Horn, Porcupine quills. Combining muggle pharmaceuticals with potions is unexplored and highly volatile. This all needs to be evaluated later. Suddenly her name is called and she steps forward.</p>

<p>“And Theodore Nott, right across the aisle from Lovegood and Malfoy please.”</p>

<p>Hermione blanches. Oh, God. NO. She steps to her seat and sits discreetly. Maybe if she comes off as withdrawn or strange, he'll leave her alone. Theodore sits in the chair beside her and turns his whole body toward her so that the full force of him is facing her. Hard Luck. She looks up and he's smiling. It's the worst, most awful, unfortunately, warm and radiant smile.</p>

<p>“Who in the heavens did I so please? My new best friend, now housemate, AND assigned potions partner? Glorious, oh glorious!”</p>

<p>More like damned, damned, damned.</p>

<p>Hermione's gaze locks onto two piercing grey eyes across the aisle and over Theo's shoulder. Great, now she's on Malfoy's hit list. Move over Harry, Undesirable No. 1. is now Hermione Jean Granger. Setting up the Cauldron, Hermione groans to Theodore, “Why are you always so chipper?”</p>

<p>“What, would you rather I brood like dearest comrade Draco?”</p>

<p>They both peek at the sickly-looking man leaning over his cauldron across the aisle. He whips his piercing glare back at Hermione and appears to be attempting to <i>incendio</i> her hair. An <i>aguamenti</i> lingers on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>Hermione swallows, “ Erm-no, I suppose that would be... worse.”</p>

<p>Again, Theo shares his radiant smile, “That's what I thought. You love me, for who I am. And I love you for you too.”</p>

<p>“That's nice.” Not knowing how to respond to that, she hands him the Flobberworm mucus and he begins measuring out the quantity with precision.</p>

<p>“You know, I've been thinking... Since you're no longer in Gryffindor, The title Gryffindor Princess doesn't seem to be suitable. It doesn't check the boxes, fill the bill, It's a “lights are in but nobody's home situation”.</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” Hermione drops the vial of wormwood essence but saves it from spilling.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“How you still have your arms and legs with that mouth of yours, is beyond me. It's going to bring about your assassination.”</p>

<p>“Ooh, that implies anticipation and mystery, makes me seem relevant.” he winks, “Anyhow, what does that phrase mean, exactly? You see, I was bored out of my wits over the summer: abusive daddy imprisoned for life and all. I have that entire horrid manor all to myself. So I thought I'd take a stroll to my neighborhood muggle pub. You know, burying said hatchet and the like. I told myself, hey, be neighborly, Theo. The pub is about a three-kilometer stroll from the manor, had to charm my oxfords with cushioning charms! Anyway, a few hours later, I finally made it to the pub. I ran into a family of squirrels and.. well.. actually that's a story for later, please do not derail me. Anyway, I made it to the pub and downed three ghastly pints of something called 'spout'”</p>

<p>Hermione interrupts, “Stout?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! See, friends are quite convenient.” Another wink, “Now let me continue, I drink three of these dark and dubious substances and find I'm utterly sloshed! I go to pay and the Barman looks at me like I'm mad! Then I realized I was trying to pay with Galleons! Galleons at a Muggle pub, Hermione! Oh, silly me! When I handed him the coins, he turned to his workfellow and uttered that phrase, you know, '

The lights are on but nobody's home.' I said, 'I do not dabble with electrons; I use candlelight. Or torches when I feel so inclined.' I attempted to explain that I didn't have pounders, but I would rush home, Floo to Gringotts, make the exchange, Floo back home, and then hurry back to the pub with his pounders in tow.”</p>

<p>Hermione, mouth agape in horror, hands the Valerian sprigs to Theo, listening intently whilst she absently grinds the asphodel petals.</p>

<p>“Oh don't look at me like that Hermione, I was plastered! I was trying to fix it. Thought I'd give him the truth. He didn't believe me anyway, He reached over the bar, grabbed me by the lapels, and began shaking me like the muggle coins would fall out of my pockets! This, this is when I knew I was, how you say, 'with a pickle'”</p>

<p>“In, IN a pickle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, semantics, paramount information..." he rolls his eyes, "All things considered, I was able to scamper off unscathed! Only had to hand over my pocket watch and jacket, which I didn't mind, as it was already a wrinkled mess. Oh and my shoes, now that was the worst of it, as I had to walk back those three kilometers, sloshed AND barefoot!”</p>

<p>Hermione erupted in laughter, “Oh my God Theo, you're an absolute pillock! How in Merlin's name are you still alive? Breathing?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! This is what I've been trying to tell you! I'm a helpless, incompetent fellow. I need, need need, an intelligent, skilled, formidable goddess as a friend, at my side. Otherwise, I'm utterly hopeless.”</p>

<p>“You know… I suppose you aren't so bad, Theodore Nott.”</p>

<p>He gleams, “I'm really Not.”</p>

<p>Professor Slughorn approaches their table, "Oh wonderful! Ms. Granger, Mr. Nott, Delightful work. What a pair these two!” Nevilles and Pansy's cauldron begins boiling over and Slughorn rushes off.</p>

<p>Theo eyes her questioningly and Hermione gives a small nod. “Yes, Nott. Friends. We can be friends.”</p>

<p>“Great! I cannot wait for all the trouble we will get up to.” He gives her another playful wink and they continue on their tasks.</p>

<p>Hermione feels a kind of warmth from Theo. He has a depth about him, It's something that he seems to want to hide from everyone. She knows this because she's the same way. He's suffered, this is certain. He's alluded to his father too many times for it not to be some kind of wound. He is complex, a book with many of the pages stuck together. She doesn't mind helping to peel some of them apart.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Ancient Runes, she finally finds herself a moment of peace. She allows her feet to lead her to a part of Hogwarts she knows she'll be left alone. On the fourth floor, down a far and forgotten corridor lies a small courtyard. It boasts a tranquil fountain and several sculptures of headless baroque figures portraying dramatic, sensuous movements. She walks around one of these, trailing her fingers across the thigh of a man in supplication, to her bench. She rounds the statue and is abruptly aware of a figure already seated, writing in a journal, Malfoy.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were here.”</p>

<p>He doesn't lift his head from the journal, “Well now you know, off with you.”</p>

<p>What an absolute little prick. She stomps her foot down, refusing to entertain him. “Actually, you know what, you get out. This is my spot, I've been coming here since the fifth year.”</p>

<p>He still refuses to spare her a glance, “I thought that moldy corner in the back of the library was 'your spot'. And no, I've been coming here since third.“</p>

<p>“It is not moldy!” He's not wrong, it can be a little humid from time to time, but it's the only part of the library no one ever roams. One of the few places she knows she won't be disturbed.</p>

<p>Finally, he meets her eye. “It's damp, Granger. All the books in the vicinity are waterlogged. It's Probably why your hair is so frizzy and maybe even why that stick slid so far up your arse.” He gives a small, devious smirk.</p>

<p>What the fuck?? She strides toward him, hovering above him while he's still seated. “Fuck you Malfoy. I punched you once and I will punch you again. No daddy to tell on either.”</p>

<p>He stands then and towers over her. She takes a step back, “What the fuck did you just say?” He steps forward, closing the distance between them again. When he speaks, his voice is low and authoritative, “The only reason I'm not rotting in Azkaban with him, as I should be, is because of you and that self-righteous hero complex of yours. Next time, keep that nose of yours in your soggy books and out of my business.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, they were going to put you in Azkaban. Harry and I... We couldn't just let that happen. You're no angel, obviously, but you were still just a child, dragged through it all.”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a child?” He stands above her and she swallows with trepidation.</p>

<p>“No. Not anymore, but- but you were. And you didn't identify Harry at the manor. I don't know why not, Malfoy. But you didn't, nonetheless. Everyone needed to know that. The things they were saying about you before- well, you didn't deserve it. I couldn't keep that on my conscious, watching you get sent there, at least not without sharing the truth first.”</p>

<p>“I'm not some pity case, Granger. I did not ask anything of you. I would never. Just- just stop acting like your a fucking savior like Potter, stop fixing everything and everyone. You're nothing without your awards and accolades. You're just a-“</p>

<p>“A filthy mudblood.”</p>

<p>He winces, “That's - that is not what I was going to say. Don't put words in my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, those words have been in and out of your mouth from the moment you stepped on the train, all those years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yea, I'm shit, Granger, I know..” He's still staring down at her, and she sees something in his eyes slip and falter. It's an imperceptible change, something you'd have to be staring at intently to notice, and she does. It's then she realizes that the world is shit. Everyone is in so much pain, all suffering in their own ways.</p>

<p>“Just forget it, Malfoy. The spot is yours.” Finally, she breaks their gaze, turns, and walks away.</p>

<hr>

<p>She's adrift, the tide pulls her, in and out. In and out.</p>

<p>She succumbs, no, embraces this.</p>

<p>The tide, the pull.</p>

<p>Leading her to open water, to the deep, blue abyss.</p>

<p>To comfort.</p>

<p>It is a river to the unknown. To being and un-being. She lets the unseen river guide her. She will not fight this, it is this feeling, the rich and sweet, which is real, absolute. The pull of it is viscous like honey, delightful and heady. She is beguiled, bewitched. The emptiness, the fullness, all at once. It is warm, like home…</p>

<p>Eyes open and dark coils are strewn across an extending arm. Fingers curl around an empty potion vial, sky blue capsules lie amongst white linens.</p>

<p>Eyes look toward the heavens to violet and gold drapes, spinning and swirling, round and round. she joins.</p>

<p>Round and round. A carousel. How Beautiful.</p>

<p>She remembers then…The small world spinning, everything was smaller then.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Mannequin horses bobbing, up and down. Laughter. A woman with bouncing curls, smiling up at a man with pure adoration in his gaze. A kiss to the temple.</p>

<p>Woman and Man.</p>

<p>Mother and Father.</p>

<p>Strangers.</p>

<p>Dead.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force rips her away, she's whisked into oblivion, all alone.</p>

<p>Child.</p>

<p>Daughter.</p>

<p>Orphan.</p>

<p>Still adrift. Forgotten, left behind…</p>

<p>When will this make sense? When will it all just end? She had tried. Tried to do it all right. She sacrificed everything. So why did she deserve this? Was it all for not

?</p>

<p>It's too much again, so she lets go, it's easier to let it all go. The current claims her with its assuring arms, so she surrenders, it's the only thing she can do.</p>

<p>Eyes close once more. Darkness comes to her again, a friend, her Casanova... She lies in wait for this forbidden lover and once again, renders herself whole when she feels its embrace.</p>

            <h2>L'appel Du Vide</h2>
            <div>
                <p>“Welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts: NeatWanker style!” Professor NeatWanker's oversized eyes attempt a wink, but only produce a constrained squint.</p>

<p>“We commence the class here in the open air of the Quidditch Pitch!” Hermione watches as several students scan their surroundings with eager anticipation. “Now, now, steady on, young rascals! Today, we shan't indulge in the sport of Quidditch, but rather the exhilarating venture of gnome foraging!” Several groans are issued from the cluster of students.</p>

<p>“Gnomes may be harmless creatures, however, they do prove to have a nasty bite, given the opportunity! Be cautious, as today you will gather the gnomes, sans wand! Only your bare hands will suffice! You will place them here, in your burlap sack.” He brandishes a jute sack and the dimensions cover his entire frame.</p>

<p>“Feel free to partner up! The entirety of the Hogwarts grounds is at your disposal, however, after you've collected your spoils, kindly return to the Quidditch Pitch and we shall proceed with our lessons! Now, come one, come all! Don't be shy, fetch a sack and a partner!”</p>

<p>Hermione surveys the crowd and her gaze lands on Malfoy, he is tugging at Theo, who is obviously struggling to break free. She continues her scan for a partner, and eyes Neville, who stands alone a few paces away.</p>

<p><i>Okay, no partner then.</i></p>

<p>Companionless, she joins the queue of students who wait for their sacks. Suddenly, there's a shove, and Theo's gangly form is wedged in beside her. An “Oi!”, most likely from Seamus, emanates from behind. She turns, to offer an apology, and is met with Malfoy's glare over Seamus's shoulder. Neville, wearing a melancholic expression, stands a few paces further behind. Quickly, she returns her attention to the front.</p>

<p>Theo bumps her shoulder, “Hey, you. A delightful day, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Hermione shoots him a sidelong glance, “Hi Theodore, are you particularly skilled in gnome foraging?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn't know, never seen one... Whole. Good ole' daddy-O kept a pack of Jarvey's around the grounds. He was particularly fond of observing their…trappings…”</p>

<p>“That's awful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I've found from personal experience that stumbling upon dismembered limbs while gathering sticks can be rather traumatising for a youngster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God. How old were you?”</p>

<p>“Six.”</p>

<p>Horrified and now positioned at the front of the queue, she retrieves a sack from the trunk and hands it to Theo.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we ought to make this a pleasant experience for you, partner.”</p>

<p>His grin is wide, “Please do.”</p>

<p>The pair venture off together and locate a thick hedge just outside the Quidditch Pitch. The sound of rustling from a large bush garners their attention. Hermione shoots Theo a look that communicates, “This one's yours”.</p>

<p>Brimming with excitement, he plunges into the hedge with gusto. The hedge trembles and shakes violently, and the foliage ripples in his fervent rummaging. Loud snaps of twigs and the crunching of leaves ensue. Theo's animated exclamations throughout the pursuit illustrate a vivid picture for Hermione's curiosity: there's a “Gaah!” And a, “You little…!” followed by a “Got you, tiny demon!”. Eventually, he emerges on all fours, clutching a gnome tightly in one hand, a victorious grin is plastered on his face.</p>

<p>“Hurry, grab the sack! Take the miniature devil! Shit, it tried to bite me!!”</p>

<p>Hermione fumbles in her attempt to open the sack, whilst Theo continues to wrestle the hostile gnome. It's especially plump around the waist and Hermione has to stretch the bag open widely for it to fit. On the way in, it's teeth latch onto her arm and she releases a sharp cry. Theo jumps to his feet and pinches the gnome's belly in an attempt to loosen its grip.</p>

<p>“Fuck! Let go, you deranged vermin!”</p>

<p>Finally, he tugs on the gnome's goatee and it releases her, she falls to the ground and scoots away. Holding the gnome upside down by the leg, avoiding it's gnashing and hissing, Theo shoves it into the sack, and quickly secures it shut. He gives it a fierce kick for good measure, then crouches down next to Hermione in the grass.</p>

<p>Taking her arm in hand he begins inspecting the open wound.</p>

<p>“Shit, are you okay Hermione?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yea…Do you— ah, fuck, do you know how to cast a healing charm?”</p>

<p>He nods, takes out his wand, and performs an Episkey. They both watch as the wound knits itself closed.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry, that was my fault. I should have..” His look of concern is poignant and Hermione feels the compulsion to send it back to the abyss from whence it came, and to never,—ever endure that look from him again.</p>

<p>“No, no! Theo— it's not your fault! I'm fine—It's all healed, just a little sore.” Her smile is weak, yet she hopes it eases his concern.</p>

<p>He seems to relax, his shoulders droop and he brushes his mousy hair from his eyes. Running his hand across his face, he lets out a heavy exhale. A few moments of silence pass, until suddenly, he brightens and rummages through the pockets of his robes, retrieving a vial containing blue liquid.</p>

<p>“It's a potion. I brewed it, it helps with pain and feeling... Well… better.”</p>

<p>Palming the vial, Hermione looks at him questioningly, his reply is a curt shrug and a devious smirk.</p>

<p>There he is.</p>

<p>Without further inquiry, she unstops the vial and downs the contents. The potion's journey down her throat produces a sting similar to liquor. Theo's smirk broadens into a grin. Once more, Theo digs through the pockets of his robes. He brandishes another vial of the same color, and swigs it. Exhausted, they both lie down amongst the vibrant grass. Then, Hermione's world tilts. Colors begin to dance across the sky languidly, laughter bubbles out from her lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, Merlin Theo. This— This is good. What have you been keeping from me?”</p>

<p>He turns his head to face her. When their eyes meet, they both erupt in laughter. Finally, Theo calms, and waves his hands in a dramatic flourish, “Yes, I'm a genius. How about I show you mine, and you show me yours?” She nods enthusiastically and the chuckling resumes.</p>

<p>They lie there, in ecstasy, far past the end of D.A.D.A. They ignore the chime of the Dinner bells and the setting of the Sun. Finally, in the dark of night, Hermione's bodily sensations return and she shivers from the crisp night air. Slowly, they peel themselves from the hard earth and walk haphazardly towards the castle. When they finally enter their house quarters, it is dark and silent. At the foot of the staircase to their separate dorms, Hermione reaches into her bag and pulls out her bottle of pills. She pours a few tablets into her hand and offers them to Theo.</p>

<p>“This helps with sleep… Among other things…Be careful.”</p>

<p>Outstretching her hand, Hermione drops a few pills into his palm. Theo stares down at them for a moment, nods, and pulls her into a tight embrace. At last, they depart their separate ways, each with bliss still thrumming through their veins.</p>

<hr>

<p>As dawn rises and peels back the curtain, Light performs her opening act. Time pauses with bated breath as Light executes an elegant arabesque and illuminates the skies, the world still paused, waits in anticipation. Finally, she hurtles across the Scottish Highlands in a magnificent Saut de Chat, the green hills erupt into the distance, and stretch on for eternity. The sky above, every blade of grass, and Draco release a shuddering exhale.</p>

<p>He shoots off, his chest flushed to the handle of his broom, as he races after her. She frolics and teases him as she prances across the ether in glittering rays. He dives, straightens, and whips across the countryside with calculated spirals — in his pursuit, dew and sweat amass on his neck and brow. Their dance is wild and controlled, peaceful and frenzied, both aware of this evanescent moment. When all darkness is finally exiled, light bounds heavenwards and finds her place with her master in the sky. Abandoned, Draco slows and collects himself with heaving breaths. For several moments, he looks on at the illuminated landscape, a soft breeze peels his damp hair off his forehead and to it, light places a gentle kiss. Finally, Draco pivots on his broom and departs.</p>

<p>Turning the handle to his room, the peace from his morning flight swiftly ceases when he is greeted by the sound of retching. In an instant, he is in the lavatory. Theo is leaning over the toilet, heaving.</p>

<p><i>Not again…</i></p>

<p>“Shit, Theo. Hold on.” Draco rushes to his trunk, yanks the lid open, and frantically rummages through it. His eyes finally catch sight of the red vial. He's only gone for a few moments, but when Draco returns, Theo now lies laterally across the tiles.</p>

<p>“Fuck.” Draco hoists him up into a sitting position against the wall.</p>

<p>“Theo! Open up, come on!” Theo's head lulls to the side, eyes moving to the back of his head. “Fuck!”</p>

<p>With his fingers, he manually pries Theo's mouth open, pours the contents in, and shuts it close. Theo begins coughing and spluttering, but Draco clasps his hand around his mouth to keep the contents in.</p>

<p>“Swallow Theo, come on! Fuck!” The spluttering continues for a few moments until finally Theo seems to take heed of Draco's request, and his throat visibly swallows. Finally, Draco unclasps his hand from Theo's mouth and moves to the wall next to his friend.</p>

<p>Ragged inhales and shaky exhales fill the room.</p>

<hr>

<p>“Hey..”</p>

<p>Hermione looks up to find Neville standing above her, his usual woeful expression on full display. Ginny, an obviously reluctant spectator, lingers behind him. Hermione fights a full-body squirm.</p>

<p>“Hi. What's this?”</p>

<p>Itching the back of his neck, he clears his throat.</p>

<p>”Erm, Just checking in, making sure you're alright.”</p>

<p>Hermione shoves her irritation down, down.“Why wouldn't it be?”</p>

<p>Neville's distress noticeably intensifies, he releases a loud exhale through his nose. Belatedly, she realizes the response was not well received.</p>

<p>"Well, you've been rather withdrawn. You never join us for meals, always rushing about and consistently late for classes now. And it seems you're avoiding me for some reason..."</p>

<p>Her mind sounds the alarm: Run, flee, hide!</p>

<p>“No, Neville... I'm sorry... I've been really busy lately... Please don't take it personally. It's only that it's been a hectic first week and all…”</p>

<p>His look of concern begins to dissipate, and he deflates slightly. "Yeah, I know this year has been tough for you. For everyone, really. Just please don't—don't shut us out, Hermione. We're a family, remember."</p>

<p><i>Family.</i></p>

<p>“Yea, yea, you're right. No, sorry, I'll be better Neville.” Hermione offers a small smile, albeit awkwardly.</p>

<p>He returns the smile broadly. "Great to hear it, Hermione. Well, I've got to go. I'm meeting Professor Sprout in the Forbidden Forest to forage for Bubotuber plants. Slughorn is running low on Bubotuber pus, so we've offered to collect some to replenish his stores.”</p>

<p>“Okay, Neville. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Neville beams, he pats Ginny on the back, gives her a pleased look, and departs toward the library exit. Ginny sinks into the chair across from Hermione and drops her head down onto the table, her mumbling into the mahogany wood is hardly audible, “Thanks for playing along.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small hum and eyes Ginny suspiciously. Sensing the glower directed her way, Ginny lifts her forehead from the table. A red blotch stretches from her hairline down to the top of her brow, she begins rubbing her eyes aggressively and lets out an exasperated groan.</p>

<p>“He's been attempting to approach you all week. He's adamant that you've been avoiding him, which is obviously true… I tried to get him to just leave off, but you know Neville, he's always fretting about one thing or another.”</p>

<p>Hermione rolls her eyes and returns her attention to her Arithmancy assignment, which is much, much, simpler.</p>

<p>“He tried to talk with me today, about Harry. All I could think about was how I wanted to slap that look off his face.”</p>

<p>Hermione drops her quill and grips her scalp, curls and all. “Aghh his eyes, Ginny! I can hardly bear to look at him anymore. That expression is always plastered on his face, you know the one—with the eyes, and the furrowed brow! I catch sight of it and all I want to do is throttle him!!” Her complaints rise in a passionate crescendo until a harsh “Shh” resonates from somewhere far away in the distance. Pince.</p>

<p>Ginny muffles a laugh into the crook of her arm, then recovers herself, “I know what you mean herms, just please, go easy on him, he's been exceptionally sensitive lately… I think he feels some kind of responsibility for keeping everyone together.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.. You're right I need to be more patient with him, he's been through a lot…” She clears her throat, "So, did you talk to him…? About Harry?</p>

<p>“No. There's not much to say, Hermione. He wants his space and I genuinely respect that decision, I've accepted it. There's not anything else to divulge.”</p>

<p>Ginny starts picking at her fingers where a reddened patch lines the side of her thumb. She's especially rough in an exposed area, and blood begins to trickle down the side of her thumb. Hermione wants to reach across the table and assure her that everything is fine; Harry is just confused, he's so afraid, he's lost everyone he'd ever loved. “He loves you, Gin.” Ginny looks up then and her eyes are glossy, “He's just— afraid.”</p>

<p>Ginny merely nods in response and returns her gaze to her fingers. They sit in silence for a few minutes. Finally, Ginny lets out a shaky exhale and looks back to Hermione. "So, it's Friday. What are your plans for the weekend? Fancy a trip to Hogsmeade?"</p>

<p>Hermione looks back down at her parchment, “I can't this weekend, I'm sorry. I— I have business…With the house and all…”</p>

<p>“I can go with you, you don't have to do it all alone. You have friends, that's what I'm for.”</p>

<p>“It's okay Gin, I need to do this alone. I want to do it alone.”</p>

<p><i>We all get through in our own ways, in our own time.</i></p>

<p>Ginny nods and doesn't pry. Instead, she shares a hug with Hermione, reassures her that she's here if she needs her, and moves to leave.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ginny?”</p>

<p>Ginny turns and cocks a brow.</p>

<p>“Is my spot,” Hermione gestures at the space around them, “Does this part of the library— does it seem moldy to you?”</p>

<p>Ginny gives an animated laugh and when she replies her back is turned and she's already strolling away, “Most definitely.”</p>

<p>Hermione scowls down at the paper in front of her. Malfoy, the tosser. She ruminates on their encounter earlier in the week, he's so fortunate not to be in Azkaban at the present moment, but he doesn't have an ounce of gratitude. He sulks and blames her—Her! Thinking of the imbecile makes her want to rip her hair out.</p>

<p>Malfoy and his sulking…</p>

<p>Neville and his worrying…</p>

<p>Ginny… Ginny and the lesions on her fingers…</p>

<p>Theo and potions…</p>

<p>Harry and nightmares…</p>

<p>Ron and drinking…</p>

<p>Herself and…</p>

<p>…Hermione and her pills.</p>

<hr>

<p>“And the more I drink, the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink… I drink, so that I may suffer twice as much!”</p>

<p><i>-Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Standing on the pavement, Hermione takes a small, shuddering breath. The familiarity and the strangeness, all at once, is heartbreaking. The house, with its charming stonework and lattice vines, fills her with a comfort only a place called home could truly provide. Home. The sight of it, once a source of solace, now gouges a hole through her heart. She approaches. In the wind, leaves swirl about, some crunch underfoot while others nudge her trainers in welcome.</p>

<p>She keys the lock and when the door swings open, the stale air hits her. Entering slowly, she scans the sitting room. The sofa and table, covered with dust, remain in their usual spots. Everything is in its place, and it feels so wrong. What was once a vibrant home, is now just an empty house. She pauses in front of a framed photo. Mom. Her Mother's eyes shine with warmth and one of her arms rests around empty air. Dad is smiling down at the space where her mother's arm rests.</p>

<p><i>Orphan.</i></p>

<p>Hermione is stone. Moments, minutes, hours, days, years, eons pass. She was forged in the beginning of time, birthed in the abyss, unearthed by jagged hands. She was formed by those same hands: molded, refined, sculpted. She was praised, glorified. The Storms and war weathered her. She deteriorated, decayed, and disintegrated to dust. Now she lives in the wind, never to be whole again.</p>

<p>Hermione leaves.</p>

<p>She gathers the post that has accumulated on the entrance floor and steps back out the door. With a final click of the lock, she turns and makes her way back down the brick path... A figure standing beyond the Pickett fence startles her. He's a lanky man, young looking, Hermione surmises, with jet black hair that falls heavily over his coal-lined eyes. He sports a leather jacket and is adorned with several pieces of jewelry: studded bracelets with spikes cover his wrists, hooped silver earrings line the side of his earlobes, and a chunky silver chain rests over his chest.</p>

<p>Hermione's hand moves toward the wand in her back pocket, “Um, Hello… How can I help you?”</p>

<p>“Hermione?” The voice is familiar, but Hermione can't place it.</p>

<p>“How do you know my name?” She's fighting the panic that is pounding in her ears telling her to RUN, RUN, RUN.</p>

<p>He seems to sense her anxiety and reaches his arms out placatingly, “Hey, Hermione. Cool down, it's just me, Jacob!” He pushes his hair from his forehead and Hermione immediately recognizes her childhood friend. “Oh my God! Jacob! Your hair! And what happened to your glasses?”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately runs over and pulls the boy she hasn't seen in ages into a tight hug. He returns the hug and when they pull apart they both examine each other. When they speak, it's simultaneously.</p>

<p>“How are you??” “How have you been?”</p>

<p>They both laugh and Jacob advances in his query “I haven't seen you in ages! Where have you been? How are you?”</p>

<p>“I've been… At school, in, erm— France.”</p>

<p>He looks at her, flabbergasted, “Wow Hermione, I knew you were bright back in the day but an international student, that's— that's great. It seems like France has treated you well…”</p>

<p>He grabs a curl, stretches it and when he lets go, there's an amused twinkle in his eye while he watches it spring back into place. Hermione swats at him playfully and looks up at his dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>“How are you, Jacob? You must have graduated, what, two years ago now? Do you still live down the street?”</p>

<p>Still smiling and peering at her with awe, he shakes his head, “No, I moved out a few years ago. Just visiting and doing some business in the neighborhood. I actually live in the Old Smoke. I run a small, humble— nightclub.”</p>

<p>His grin morphs into a smirk. The incessant smiling and his flirtatious behavior confounds her, she blushes profusely.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow! That's pretty wicked, Jacob.”</p>

<p>He seems pleased by the praise and reaches into his back pocket, he pulls out his wallet and rifles through the cardholders. Hermione eyes a tiny plastic bag filled with white shiny powder wedged between a thick wad of banknotes. She swiftly deflects her gaze.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he hands her a card with the name <i>The Velvet Flame.</i></p>

<p>“In case you ever find yourself in the city, looking for a familiar face. I live upstairs, just let the bouncer know you're looking to 'climb Jacob's ladder'.” Hermione stares down at the card, her face is set aflame. She gives him a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>“Real smooth Jacob, however, I will not be climbing any of your ladders.”</p>

<p>“Oh calm, Hermione. It's just a way I distinguish my true friends from those who pretend to be, just to skip the line. It's not meant to be taken literally, it's used commonly enough by my closest of friends.” With a final wink, he begins to back away.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I've got to run, it's almost six, and I have some last-minute preparations to see to before we open for the night. Maybe I'll see you soon?”</p>

<p>He continues backing away and she responds with a small nod. She mumbles, mostly to herself, “Yeah, Jacob, you just might.”</p>

            <h2>Tactics and Tension</h2>
            <div>
<p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>

<p>Despite the reality of whose fault it actually is, the apology spills from her lips, unbidden. Hermione silently chides herself for insinuating she's to blame, after all, it was the stranger who had crashed into her.</p>

<p>The encounter was akin to being struck by a train: there she was, minding her own business, as is decent—a habit all should practice—when suddenly a force barrelled into her, knocking her breath away, along with everything she had been carrying.</p>

<p>She peers down at the wreckage: books lie strewn across the floor whilst parchment flutters to the stone like feathers plucked from an unfortunate bird. Hermione quickly drops to the floor, determinedly ignoring the shooting pain as her knees collide with the unforgiving stone, and begins the hasty task of stacking books and corralling parchment. Whilst gathering papers by the dozens, she pauses, noticing the penmanship dancing across a page. The script, which slants slightly to the left, is neat with tidy pacing. The letters are pointed, deliberate, and intense. Never has she seen handwriting so organized, yet eloquent.</p>

<p><i>It's quite beautiful.</i></p>

<p>She feels the beginning of a blush creeping upon her cheeks when she realizes how close the parchment is held to her face--obviously ogling the contents, with the owner hovering close by no less. Admonishing herself for the intrusion of privacy, she resumes gathering the items.</p>

<p>When reaching to gather a scroll tied with a silver ribbon, her grasp coincides with- no, not paper...but soft skin. She stares down at the phantom-looking hand trapped under her own; at the long, pale fingers which radiate warmth under her touch.</p>

<p><i>A ghost?</i></p>

<p>She disregards the thought- surely Peeves and Nearly Headless Nick are substantially more translucent than this, and undoubtedly less warm.</p>

<p><i>Irrationally and seemingly plagued by insanity, she allows her thumb to graze across the backside of the palm and watches as the phantom fingers twitch in response.</i></p>

<p><i>Not a ghost.</i></p>

<p>Mortified, she peeks a glance at the stranger in front of her. Mere centimeters from her own, she finds two granite eyes with light-blue fissures coursing through them like glacial rivers.</p>

<p>“Boo.”</p>

<p>Hermione gasps, rears backward, and tumbles to the floor, landing painfully on her arse. The satchel in her arms falls with her, and some of its contents escape.</p>

<p>Hermione is not surprised when Malfoy ignores the commotion. Although, she does not miss the infinitesimal quirk of his upper lip, seemingly pleased with the reaction he was able to conjure. He moves to grab the remainder of his belongings from the floor, then straightens to his full height. Rooted to the stone, Hermione stares up at him on her elbows, flustered. He gives her a contemptuous look, as if she's something unpleasant he's found under his shoe, and raises an eyebrow. Hermione scowls.</p>

<p>“I ought to have known. Only a psychopath has penmanship like that.”</p>

<p>“That is quite hypocritical coming from the castle pedant.”</p>

<p>Hermione swiftly gathers her items, stuffing her journal and bottle of pills back into her satchel. She busies herself and makes a silent prayer that Malfoy has already gone. Please, Please, Please… Rising to her feet and brushing the hair from her eyes, she becomes aware of his lingering presence. Great. His gaze is scrutinizing, shrewd, and something else, curious? Despite it, she's left feeling uncomfortably exposed.</p>

<p>He nods toward her fastened satchel, “What is that?"</p>

<p>Hermione raises a brow. “What's what, Malfoy? My bag?”</p>

<p>He narrows his eyes, “What's in the bottle?”</p>

<p><i>The audacity.</i></p>

<p>She narrows her eyes in return. “Oh, it's something called, none of your damn business.”</p>

<p>“How intriguing, it appears you're carrying muggle medicine… Curiously enough, I recently stumbled upon a few muggle capsules littered across Theo's desk.”</p>

<p><i>Of course, he did. Oh, Theo, that slob.</i></p>

<p>She masks her culpability with a disapproving tut, “Sounds awfully like an admission, Malfoy. Were you slithering about, pilfering through my dear friend, Theodore's things?”</p>

<p>His eye twitches. A satisfying sense of triumph buoys her spirits, she stands a tad taller.</p>

<p>His renowned sneer makes an unfortunate appearance, “You're friend??”</p>

<p>Watching his indignation bloat and expand is thrilling. It's the risk, the danger that spurs her forward. She can't help it. Cannot help it. This is too good.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, yes.” She wrestles the grin that is trying to break free from her lips into a sly curve, “We're best friends, said so himself. He seems quite taken by me. It's almost as if, all this time he's been starved for companionship, and I couldn't help but wonder why. Then I realised, it's you. Being your friend must be like sitting in cold, wet darkness for ages, don't be peeved he's finally found the light.” The way his nostrils flare validates how good she is at getting under his skin and the power courses through her veins. Her Ego nudges her lips, just a little more, for effect, “In fact, I was just about to go meet with him, and you know, vow my fidelity and homage.”</p>

<p>If he caught her sarcasm, he certainly didn't acknowledge it. He swiftly moves, entering her space to loom over her. His frenzied state is equal parts terrifying in its intensity, and comical in its absurdity. Staring up at his pinched lips, and furrowed brow, Hermione fights her urge to burst into laughter.</p>

<p>He growls then, actually growls, “Granger, he's MY friend. MINE. Has been MY friend for years, will be MY friend for many more to come, long past the time that you will have grown tired of him.”</p>

<p>Hermione feels something deep within her snap. His twisted possessiveness ceases to be amusing; it's utterly repugnant. Somehow her previous proclamation of vowing fidelity and homage to her friend is the only thing at the forefront of her mind, and she allows her indignation to guide her.</p>

<p>“Yours? YOURS?? Is he your pet? Did you adopt him? Did you stroll to the pound, take a gander around, spot him wagging his tail about, and say 'Oh daddy, I want that one'? You're a little git, Malfoy, to think you can look at a person and say, 'that's mine'. Outrageous! You rapacious, egotistical, slimy snake! You have ME to contend with if you think you can go about claiming him as only yours!”</p>

<p>Malfoy clenches his jaw and flares his nostrils, seemingly attempting to master his rage. When he speaks, she's stunned by his authenticity.</p>

<p>“Theodore needs me. I can't—won't allow anything happen to him. He's…Salazar, why am I even explaining this to you?” He shakes his head ridding himself of all remaining human decency and stiffens like the callous wraith he is. When he continues, his eyes are distant and brutal, “Just leave him alone. You're wrong for him. Your trouble, I can sense these things. You're going to hurt him, perhaps you already have, and I… I'll be the one to have to pick up the pieces.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for her response, Malfoy shoulders his satchel and swiftly strides away. Alone in the empty corridor, Hermione who is heaving irate breaths, begins calculating his demise.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Draco is acutely aware that something needs to change. He needs to relax. The stress of being back at Hogwarts is pushing his agitation to levels reminiscent of sixth year, and it's only the middle of the second week.</p>

<p>The reality of being stuck sharing a common room with people who, only a few months ago, he had been forced to torture and ultimately battle, is overwhelming in itself. Add to that, his concerns about his mother, the frosty reception from his former friends, and the sight of his best friend cozying up to Granger, it's no wonder he's on edge.</p>

<p>Theo's overdose last week was the coup de grace. He can't concentrate, can't sleep. For Salazar's sake, he can't even seem to watch where he's going, proven by his collision with the bint, two days ago. She always has a way of rattling him, and since the encounter, he's been on the precipice of madness.</p>

<p>His mind drifts momentarily towards the fire whisky he has stashed in his trunk. No. He needs to stay focused on his courses, his studies, finishing the year, and getting out. Out!</p>

<p>And so, here he is, lugging a stack of books stacked so high, they reach his chin. Even with the aid of a shrinking charm, his bag is full to the brim, so he takes it upon himself to carry the rest. The balancing act makes it quite difficult to turn the nob and push open the door to his room, so he opts for entering backward.</p>

<p>Without warning, he's alerted to the sounds of giggling trickling from Theo's half of the room. He places the pile of books on his desk, strides to Theo's bed, and whips back the drapes.</p>

<p>Theo is sitting against his headboard, a hand over his mouth, laughter obviously trying to break free. Hermione Granger is stretched out like a cat at the foot of the bed, wearing her devious smirk. He knows that smirk, he knows this game. He knows her modus operandi: Get under his skin. He shoots a glance at Theo for letting the enemy in their room, in his space.</p>

<p>His words fight past his tightly shut jaw, “Theo, may I have a word?”</p>

<p>Hermione sits up and stretches her arms like the devilish cat she is. Her skirt rides up slightly in the process and Draco glances down at her exposed thigh. <i>Fucking hell.</i> From the corner of his eye, he notices Theo watching him…watch her. Draco immediately averts his gaze, opting to focus on the wall instead. Hermione eventually notices her raised skirt and hastily adjusts it before donning her robes. Snatching the remainder of her belongings from the side table, she turns her attention back to Theo, who is still lounging against the headboard.</p>

<p>“It's alright Theodore, I really must be off. There's a snug corner of the library calling my name.” Hermione shoots a brief glare at Draco before refocusing on Theo. "Thanks for the… delightful diversion," she adds with a playful wink. As the two's eyes meet, they share a rather exaggerated and slightly obnoxious giggle.</p>

<p>"See you at dinner?" Theo nods in agreement, and Hermione makes her way towards the door.</p>

<p>Draco, determined to win whatever twisted game this is, bends down to the floor and retrieves a pair of Theo's dirty socks. With the agility of a seasoned seeker, in which he is, chucks it at the back of her head. There's a resounding thud against her helmet of unruly hair.</p>

<p>She whips around, her brows knitted tightly in outrage. Oddly enough, tormenting the twit seems to alleviate some of his stress. Draco shucks that forbidden thought away, promptly and indefinitely.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes about you Granger” He's aglow in his might. <i>Granger delenda est.</i></p>

<p>Her eyes are flaming, “One of these days Malfoy…You will get what's coming to you… You won't even know what hit you.”</p>

<p>And with that she strides across the threshold of the room, the door rattling shut in her wake.</p>

<p>“Wow, that was riveting. I'd be very worried if I were you...”</p>

<p>“She's nothing I have to worry about. What is Salazar's name was that?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh I don't know, Theodore.” He annunciates the name like she had, “She's a harpy, Theo, she'll dry out your bollocks, hang them by a string and use them to mark the musty pages of her books. Why are you faffing about with bloody Granger? She's a psycho, why would you let her in our room? Why was she here??”</p>

<p>Theo waves him off, ”She's my friend. I like her. Plus she's fun, more fun than you.”</p>

<p>“Swot and fun are not synonymous. In fact, they are incongruous. Granger is not fun.” He repeats the last sentence more for his own comfort.</p>

<p>Theo shrugs, “I like her.”</p>

<p>"Like her, like her?” Draco cringes at the thought.</p>

<p>Theo's nose crinkles and Draco is relieved to see it. “No, no. Not in that way, she's just— she understands, Draco.”</p>

<p>Draco looks down at the books he's brought from the library, carefully deliberating how to make his approach. He opts for veracity.</p>

<p>“Theo, we just have to get through the year… you should be focusing on your studies, not having 'fun' with Granger. Don't bring her back here. The mere sight of her is aggravating.”</p>

<p>Theo smirks devilishly, “Yes… It seems the sight of her does have quite the effect on you…”</p>

<p>Draco harrumphs, disregards his so-called 'friend', and turns back to his desk. He seats himself determinedly and surveys the mountain of books sprawled across the surface. He feels marginally less irritated than earlier and they don't appear as daunting. He doesn't dare question why that may be, but instead, with this newly found ease, takes one in hand and flips open the cover.</p>

            <h2>Resistentialism, A Case of: Part I</h2>
            <div>
<h3>July 1998, Two Months Prior</h3>

<p>“There is a letter for you.”</p>

<p>Draco reaches down, brushing the Floo dust from his trousers. When he finally looks up to his mother, he notices her outstretched hand offering an ivory letter. Not a second out of the hearth and here she is, obviously awaiting his return. How long has she been standing here, waiting? Draco's attention flickers to the letter, still hovering in midair by delicate fingers, and he notices the Hogwarts seal embossed on the back. His brow furrows and he eyes the letter apprehensively.</p>

<p>“What's this? I've already received my Hogwarts letter last week.”</p>

<p>Following the end of his trials, Draco received his letter from the headmaster herself. There was a boom of the gavel, and in a flurry of moments, Professor McGonagall had appeared in front of him, politely handing him an all too familiar envelope. His thumb had slowly brushed over the crimson Hogwarts seal, eyes flitting down to the four houses engraved into the parchment. She had made a sound, likely a cough, and Draco was brought from his stupor and focused on her stoic face.</p>

<p>“Hogwarts would be honored to have you return for your eighth year if you would accept.”</p>

<p>No mention of the fact that he was required to return, Ministry's orders. Despite her cordial disposition, Draco had intently read her pursed lips and shrewd eyes which had quietly relayed, “No, funny business this year, Mr. Malfoy.” Still reeling from the fact that he was, in essence, dismissed from all his war crimes, Draco had only nodded and swallowed the lump in his throat.</p>

<p>So why is his mother handing him a letter with the same seal? What if they had changed their minds? Maybe they've realized their mistake and no longer desire a death eater on the grounds…What if it's a letter of retraction? What would happen if he was unable to fulfill his probation requirement? Would he be sent to Azkaban?</p>

<p>Draco feels the familiar symptoms of panic rushing through his veins. He tries repeatedly to reinforce the walls of his occlumency which have momentarily faltered. But the pounding of his heart hammering through his chest, is loud and distracting. His posture gives none of this away, remaining the image of impassivity. But then the pinky on his right-hand twitches minutely.</p>

<p>His mother's eyes flit to his hand. <i>Shit, She's noticed.</i></p>

<p>“Draco…Darling…” Draco watches as his mother goes frigid and the color drains from her face.</p>

<p>Panic, the infectious worm has wiggled its way to her. He can see it crawling under her skin, ripping its way through her mind, boring into every crevice of her sanity. She takes a few heaving breaths, her chest sinking and collapsing with every exhale. She's so fragile like this, he can't stand it. In his desire to just have the moment end, he strides forward and takes the letter from her trembling grasp. Without hesitating he rips the seal and holds his breath in trepidation. His fingers fumble in parting the letter from its envelope. However, the damning words he expects—are not there...</p>

<p><i>Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy,</i></p>

<p><i>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is pleased to bestow the Portrait of former Headmaster and Professor, Severus Snape, into your custodianship.</i></p>

<p><i>Following careful consideration by the Hogwarts Board of Governors and the persistent petitions of the Portrait of Headmaster Severus Snape himself, it has been determined that the most suitable and dignified residence for the portrait would be under the care of his Godson, at Malfoy Manor. We kindly request your presence at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to collect the portrait at your earliest convenience. Until then, the portrait will be awaiting its departure under the care of Horace Slughorn. Thank you for your cooperation.</i></p>

<p><i>With Sincerest Gratitude,</i></p>

<p><i>Hogwarts Board of Governors</i></p>

<p>Draco stares down at the letter, completely dumbstruck. “It's—It's Professor Snape, he's…I am—The Hogwarts Board of Governors requests that I be the proprietor of his portrait.”</p>

<p>Narcissa releases a heavy breath and takes the letter. Her hand rests over her heart as she reads, humming in comprehension every so often.</p>

<p>“Oh. Yes—Yes. Well… we must accept. Severus, contrary to his behaviour, was never one for blatant ostentation. I doubt his portrait would revel in exhibition; I do believe he would prefer a significantly calmer and solitary environment. I think the south hall would do, there is the window that overlooks the gardens…”</p>

<p>“We will not accept.” The words are sharp and final.</p>

<p>His mother's eyes dart to Draco's own. “Draco… This is obviously a request by Severus himself.”</p>

<p>“No, It is the portrait's request, one I will not be fulfilling.”</p>

<p>She doesn't attempt to conceal her dismay. The way in which she stares into his eyes, searching, her forehead creased in concern, has Draco turning towards the window. He stares out at the setting sun, at the darkness vying for freedom within the shadows of the trees. He thinks, only a few more minutes and the dark will wreak its havoc. Draco tightens his jaw in newfound resolve.</p>

<p>“I was a pawn to him. He used me because he had to. He made a vow and he fulfilled his duties, nothing more. He never cared for any of us, Mother. We were left in the dark, forced to face the chaos due to the deliberate omission of his plans, his true allegiance… In the end, it was always Potter whom he was protecting, Not us. Not me, not father, not you…He could have saved us, he could have gotten us out. But he didn't. And so, we will not be accepting the portrait.”</p>

<p>Draco doesn't dare look at her face, he knows what he'll see and it will shatter his heart. Instead, he turns back around, heads toward the Floo, and grabs a handful of powder. He can see the figure of his mother in his periphery as he quietly mumbles "Nott Manor". When the flames rise to consume him, she finally disappears.</p>

<h3>Present Day</h3>

<p>There is a desk in the common room Draco has grown fond of. It's tucked away from the main footpath, yet still offers a view of the room's affairs. Draco feels it necessary to be aware of his surroundings at all times; awareness is survival. Plus, he likes to keep tabs on the people around him, despite not being fond of the half of them. They can be a source of entertainment, especially when one's assigned reading is particularly dull.</p>

<p>The Brown girl is seated at her usual sofa facing the large window; she's like a ghost, always wearing high-neck blouses, always sullen. Weasley sits with Longbottom at a table not too far behind Brown; the red she-weasel has been picking at her fingers for the last half hour. When Granger scurried past a few minutes ago, Neville put on the most aggravating face of concern. Draco can't stand to look at it, so he doesn't. His glance drifts to Blaise, who is sprawled on another sofa at the opposite end of the room to Brown's. His head is thrown back against the top of the couch, his mouth gaping open as he snores loudly. Pansy is curled up on the other end of the sofa, her onyx fringe covers her eyes. She writes aggressively in a journal, and ever so often she uses her sleeves to covertly wipe at her eyes.</p>

<p>Draco reorients his attention back to his current activities. Focus. Ruins. He reverts his gaze to his book. Then suddenly, a pair of shiny black loafers flit by in his periphery vision. Draco snaps his head up, “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>Theo hits himself in the face with the black journal he's carrying and groans, “Shit, thought you wouldn't notice me. I'm off to meet Hermione.”</p>

<p>“Granger, again? When are you coming back?”</p>

<p>Theo rolls his eyes, “You know, people are going to start to wonder why you're so obsessed with me and everything I do. Some might get the wrong idea."</p>

<p>“I'm not obsessed. It is not my fault that you require supervision. Look at what happened the last time you went out frolicking with her. I feel like a mother hen, minding a flightless chick who is prone to perils, such as leaping off dodgy ledges. It's exhausting. If my own mother wasn't so fond of you, I'd gladly turn my cheek and let you soar off any ledge to your heart's content.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest Narcissa. She does love me, doesn't she? How is she?”</p>

<p>Draco is not surprised that Theo can simply disregard ninety percent of what he has just said. He goes back to his reading, opting for ambiguity because, well, Merlin knows, conversation is a nonsensical undertaking.</p>

<p>“She's alright. Sends her regards.” He casually brandishes the envelope he received at breakfast. Draco refrains from disclosing that his mother is, in fact, not doing well. The parchment is strewn with her scribbles, parts of it indecipherable at times. He doesn't mention that her correspondence was solely related to flowers. Nor does he reveal that she repeated the same sentence twice in a row, then once more at the end of the letter: "The Begonias are blooming near your bench in the garden: be cautious, be cordial, do not make enemies.”</p>

<p>Theo regards Draco with an air of concern. "Draco, I understand you're stressed and tired. But if you could please try to tone it down a bit. I promise everything will be alright. Maybe you could try taking a walk every once in a while, or journaling; that might be helpful for your... stress."</p>

<p>Draco, unaccustomed to receiving such distasteful gestures of pity, seethes, "I could stop being stressed and tired if you'd deign to stop being such a nuisance! I'm stressed and tired because of your antics, Theo. I'm stressed and tired because you need to be surveilled regularly! I'm stressed and tired because you won't listen! I'M STRESSED AND TIRED BECAUSE I'M CONSTANTLY SAVING YOUR LIFE!"</p>

<p>The silence in the room is tangible. Draco looks around the common room and everyone's eyes are fixed on him and Theo. The sounds of shuffling papers fill the air as others grab their belongings and retreat to their rooms or out the door. Had he really been that loud? Had he yelled?</p>

<p>Draco winces at the thought and finally steals a glance at his friend. Theo is devoid of his usual exuberance and zest. Only a grave expression remains on his face, he lifts his chin and sniffs scornfully. "So be it Draco. The next time you find me, just let me die and then I will be out of your hair… And then, you can finally rest.”</p>

<p>When Theo leaves, Draco doesn't bother to glance around to see who's still watching. He fortifies his occlumency shields to a level he's rarely needed since facing Voldemort himself, and then, once safely behind the walls of his mind, he rages.</p>

<h3>“Hello, Goddess”</h3>

<p>Hermione lifts her head. Theo stands, clutching a battered-looking journal at the entrance to the alcove she's occupying. Two benches line either side of the small space and in between rests a window overlooking the Greenhouses. Theo settles himself on the bench opposite her own and grins widely in her direction. The flash of his teeth catches Hermione off guard and she spills her tea all over her white button-up.</p>

<p>“Theodore! Agh, my blouse! Why in heaven's name are your teeth… green?”</p>

<p>He ignores her statement entirely, “I think I'm in love…”</p>

<p>Hermione reddens and looks around awkwardly avoiding his gaze. If this plonker starts reciting a declaration of love…</p>

<p>Theo seems to understand his implications and rushes to correct himself.</p>

<p>"Not you! Hermione—I do love you, you know that… but only as a friend." The green of his teeth remains a looming presence, but the relief she finds in his words is of far greater impact.</p>

<p>Theo continues, “We'd never work, apologies love. You're far too wild and feisty, plus, too smart for your good! What you need in a lover is someone tenacious and clever.. someone, austere and watchful…”</p>

<p>Hermione breaks in, “Are you describing a lover or a prison guard?”</p>

<p>“.. Someone, draconian…” Theo blanches and his eyes go wide like he's discovered some kind of horrible error in the cosmos. Catching himself, he recovers quickly with an uneasy laugh, “Oh, ha! God that'd be awful…”</p>

<p>Hermione crinkles her nose in distaste, “I should have you scrub your mouth for saying that. I suppose that I should, as your teeth are green... You're one to call me wild, Theo you're nutters! You are the one going about terrorizing muggle pubs, calling people “Goddess”, whilst manipulating them into being your friend! In fact, you seem like you need someone ‘stoic and draconian' to watch over your barmy behavior.”</p>

<p>Theo scowls darkly and Hermione flinches, she didn't think Theo was capable of a scowl. He takes his wand and transforms his journal into a mirror, the scowl and darkness dissipates as he surveys the issue with his teeth.</p>

<p>He grumbles into the mirror, “I don't need watching… I have enough of that from the resident tyrant.”</p>

<p>Hermione is giddy to join in this degradation of Malfoy's character, “Yeah, what's his problem, Theo? He's such an arse, his contempt towards me has increased tenfold since befriending you. Like I had any choice in the matter! He acts as though you are some kind of mangy puppy he has to look after! He's obsessed!”</p>

<p>Theo, still scowling into the mirror, begins scraping at his teeth with his finger, “…I think he is…”</p>

<p>“… It's like he's in love with you!” Hermione pants.</p>

<p>Finally, Theo glances at her. Trouble and mischief dance in his eyes, “As a matter of fact...I think he is..”</p>

<p>Hermione stares at him blankly while he returns going about his business in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Oh Merlin, Theodore…” Her hands go to her chest “Draco's?…” her hand moves to cup her mouth “He's… I didn't know he was—not that I would judge him for it… but I've just never known he prefers…”</p>

<p>She removes her hand and clears her throat, “…So, he's in love with you?”</p>

<p>Theodore, a.k.a. Narcissus and his pond, the picture of nonchalance, nods into his reflection solemnly, “It really can be a curse…To be loved so fiercely.”</p>

<p>Hermione competes with the mirror to capture his gaze, “And you…?”</p>

<p>Theodore peeks a look at her from the corner of his eye, comprehending her suspicion, “NO! MERLIN—NO, NOT HIM!! It's… It's—Luna, Luna Lovegood.”</p>

<p>Hermione is taken aback, “Oh…” she blinks, then registers what he just said, “Hold on, what? Luna? How? And more importantly, why? I mean—she's lovely and all but…Luna, she's—well..” Hermione finally supplies with great insight, “She's Luna.”</p>

<p>Dearest Theodore is still scrubbing at his teeth in the mirror, he takes out his wand and performs a Scourgify, a Tergeo, and tries several other incantations.</p>

<p>“Agh! Nothing's working! And I still have that blasted taste in my mouth!” He smacks his lips together, tasting. “Copper.. and… onions... Bleck. Luna may be wonderful but Gurdyroot is abominable.”</p>

<p>Hermione gapes in horror, “You tasted it?!”</p>

<p>“Well yeah, she was staring at me with those angelic, alluring, oversized eyes, behind the goggles, of course, so I had to! She just watched as I took a sip, and her eyes would not relent! So I began drinking it. Her gaze—I was entranced, Hermione! I began quaffing it in earnest, she finally dropped the spell when it was gone. Merlin, I was heaving by the end of it, I almost retched all over her Mary Jane's!”</p>

<p>“You drank it ALL??”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was horrid. Worst decision of my life, but somehow also the best! Her reaction, Hermione—her smile was resplendent! She said the mole on my neck means I'm honorable! She thinks I'm honorable! No one has ever said that to me. I think—I think I may be in love.”</p>

<p>“In love—with LUNA of all people? I can't process this, I might need some of that potion, Theodore.”</p>

<p>“Well… that brings me to my original reason for seeking you out. I need to brew again… I have most of the ingredients already, but I'm just missing a wee bit of Wormwood.”</p>

<p>Hermione ponders this. Wormwood...commonly used for Euphoria Elixir... “Is that what it is, Euphoria Elixir?”</p>

<p>Theo hums in delight, "I knew you were as smart as they say, Hermione. It's not exactly that, but very similar. The potion's base is Euphoria Elixir, but it has some personalized tweaks... a combination of ingredients related to calming draught, among others… However, I've run out of my supply of wormwood, we only need a few drops of the essence..."</p>

<p>“Wormwood essence?? Theo, that's not something that we can easily come by.”</p>

<p>His glance jumps to the window at the greenhouses below, “We can try sprout.”</p>

<p>Hermione huffs, “That's ridiculous. She may have the plants, but extracting the essence is time-consuming and requires several fully-grown plants. It's not exactly harvesting season and Sprout will most definitely notice if half of her supply goes missing.”</p>

<p>Theo contemplates this, “What about Slughorn?”</p>

<p>Hermione lowers her voice to a whisper, “You mean to nick Wormwood essence from Slughorn's potion cabinet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, precisely.” He grins, “I know there is a bottle of it in there, I've seen it. He won't even notice.”</p>

<p>Hermione contemplates this. If they were to just slip in, snatch a few drops… They'd be in and out in an instant... There's really no consequence to the matter. Slughorn wouldn't know the difference.</p>

<p>She sighs in acquiescence, “Alright, Theodore, I'm trusting you. We will be in and out, no complications.”</p>

<p>Theo's teeth perpetually green, are brandished atrociously in an open grin, “Yes It'll be simple, and trust me, no funny business on my part.”</p>

<p>Hermione stands, reluctantly succumbing to the scheme. "Alright then, lead the way..."</p>

            <div>
            <h2>Resistentialism, A Case of: Part II</h2>
            <p>Hermione finds the title 'Potion's Room Extended Cabinet' inadequate for the necropolis she currently finds herself standing in. The space is cluttered with rusty cauldrons, quite likely from the bowels of the dark ages, ranging in sizes small enough for Hermione to hold in her palm and large enough to rival the size of hot tubs. Ominous-looking Stirring sticks of like-wise varieties are stuffed in jars and pitchers that border a slender and jagged footpath, similar to flowers that line a garden promenade. Hermione reflexively tugs Theodore's collar, yanking him towards her, narrowly preventing his distracted face from colliding with a stirring stick the size of a canoe paddle. Theo staggers inelegantly, his polished loafers scuffing the stone floor until finally he straightens and tidies his robes.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione continues scanning the space. Carved into the walls are shelves bearing every ingredient a Potioneer could dream of. Dusty and cobweb-covered, vials, and jars stretch from floor to ceiling, and the extent of the cache seems to stretch on endlessly down a dimly lit hallway.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione is affronted. “Hogwarts does not have endless resources, my arse! This place is chock-full of ingredients! Slughorn, that greedy snake!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore, already rummaging through a stockpile of jars, turns to face her, “See, as I said, he won't even notice.”</p>
        
        <p>He resumes his perusal of the shelves and Hermione joins, all previously held shame whisked out the window. Fueled by her disgust, she nicks a few items from a nearby shelf and roughly shoves them into her beaded bag.</p>
        
        <p>Theo twists his head over his shoulder and regards her with raised brows. “Come now, don't be greedy.”</p>
        
        <p>“Slughorn does not need that amount of powdered moonstone or dittany; they do go rancid after a time… Besides, proper experimentation does require an array of materials.” She shoots him a mischievous wink and pivots back to the shelves.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, Theo! Look here!” Theodore, who stands on the other side of the room, presently wedged between two massive cauldrons, swivels precariously on his heel to face her.</p>
        
        <p>“It's a vial of Twinkling Teeth! It should help rid the green!” Unthinking, she tosses the bottle toward him and watches it arc across the room. Theodore's long, lanky arms shoot up in a miserable attempt to snag the vial. Wedged immovably between two cauldrons, the result is a flurry of flailing limbs which cause his fringe to flop over his eyes, effectively obscuring his view.</p>
        
        <p>Briefly, Hermione's mind flashes to the memory of attending an art exposition with her parents, wherein the performers donned long hair that had masked their faces entirely. Without the accompaniment of music, they began to dance about in a frenzy of abstract movements made entirely of limbs and torsos. Hermione is helpless to ignore the thought that, Theodore Nott would do exceptionally well as an interpretive dancer. She breaks from her stupor when she realizes the vial's trajectory is directly aimed at his face, he's still oblivious to this fact, and this time, she is too far to intervene. “Oh, dear… Theo watch out!”</p>
        
        <p>It's too late, the vial has already met its target—his left eye. “AHHGG!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore clasps his hand over his eye. The bottle, which had bounced off said eye, locates its new trajectory, the stone floor. It shatters.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh Fuck, Theo, I'm so sorry!”</p>
        
        <p>“Why did you throw it at my eye??”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione gasps in indignation, “Theodore, I did not aim for your eye! I thought you'd catch it!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo still holding his hand to his eye grumbles angrily, “I apologize that my reflexes are not on par with your superior athleticism!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione huffs, “Theodore, I have never in my life been described as athletic—to any degree. Though… I suppose a year of living out of a tent and being hunted and tortured by a megalomaniac would add agility to one's skillset.”</p>
        
        <p>“In future instances, I implore you to designate activities requiring such agility to some other unfortunate friend. I have seen quite enough.” He emphasizes this by lifting his hand from his eye. It already appears to be swelling; dark discolorations beginning to form over the lid.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione takes another vial of Twinkling Teeth off the shelf and shuffles her way across the room towards him. His head is tipped back to the ceiling while he taps at his eye, wincing every few moments. When she reaches him, she receives an up-close view of the monstrosity before her. Theodore's left eye is bloodshot and watering profusely. The lid is puffed up, limiting his mobility to a state of half-liddedness. A spider web of veins crisscross over it in a shade of green that rivals his stained teeth. He looks at her, and a tear parts from his grotesque eye.</p>
        
        <p>“How—How, does it look?”</p>
        
        <p>Staring into it, Hermione feels her own eyes begin to water from the sight. She averts her gaze, reaching into her beaded bag to retrieve the dittany she had pilfered, then silently conjures bandages and a clean cloth. Seating him on a nearby trunk, she makes quick work of applying the dittany and wrapping the bandage around his head.</p>
        
        <p>“All will be well soon, no need to worry.” Theo only nods in response. Hermione hands him the bottle of Twinkling Teeth and he accepts without protest, downing it in a single swig. He bears his teeth to her, “Is the green gone?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione stares at his teeth, no longer green, but white. A blinding, brilliant white, like staring at the sun through a mirror. She stutters an appeasing, “Yes—Erm—Definitely no longer, green.” Then, smiling awkwardly, turns away, “Alright. Now that, that— is settled, let's get back to our search.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo groans and shifts back to an upright position and resumes his scouring of the shelves. Hermione decides to continue her search where she had begun. She tiptoes back to her place, dodging the large cauldrons, broken glass, and an array of open trunks and boxes filled with various contents. Unaware of a coverlet strewn haphazardly across the walkway, with one end draped over a wooden box, she trips. Her stumble propels her into a nearby large shelf, causing the glass jars and vials to jostle and clatter.</p>
        
        <p>“Shite!” Incensed, she picks up the quilted cover with the goal of hurling it back at the box. However, when she draws back her arm to enact the blow, she stills, all the color drains from her face.</p>
        
        <p>Gazing into the box, her eyes meet the familiar glare of Professor Severus Snape. She releases a startled gasp.</p>
        
        <p>On the other end of the room, Theo whirls around and takes a stance like a startled deer ready for flight. His one eye shooting about in every direction, “What is it??"</p>
        
        <p>Her heart is thumping loudly in her chest when she finally meets Theo's good eye.</p>
        
        <p>“Why is Professor Snape's portrait in a box in the potion's cabinet?”</p>
        
        <p>His single eye blinks and he relaxes, “How should I know?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione lowers onto her haunches and leans down to the painting.</p>
        
        <p>“Hello… Erm—Professor Snape who did this to you?”</p>
        
        <p>His answering snarl has Hermione pulling back slightly.</p>
        
        <p>“You fool, I requested it! All that I have ever desired was complete, uninterrupted solitude. It appears that even in death, I cannot be afforded such luxuries!” His sneer is mighty. Hermione can't seem to control her psychosomatic response of flinching, and bizarrely awaiting the removal of house points.</p>
        
        <p>Her anxiety gives way to pity when she realises he is only a portrait and his powers are limited. “Professor, you cannot exist out of a box—in a creepy and abandoned potion's cabinet!”</p>
        
        <p>“I have never been in better company.”</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, the sound of distant voices emanate from outside the potions classroom. Hermione looks to Theo, who has paused in his inspection, they both share the same look communicating, “Time to leave”.</p>
        
        <p>Theo urgently whisper-yells from his station across the room, “How about the wormwood essence? We can't just leave without it!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione frantically surveys her surroundings, when all of a sudden, a light switch in the back of her mind flicks on. “Accio Wormwood essence!”</p>
        
        <p>Instantly, eight bottles come hurtling towards her from various directions. She manages to catch four, while two collide with the shelf behind her, and the remaining two careen past her, striking Theo in the head and abdomen, respectively. He lets out another yelp and Hermione finds herself growing tired of his noisy complaints, “Oh hush! You'll have us caught!”</p>
        
        <p>Professor Snape releases a sigh of relief, “I take it you will finally indulge my wishes and obligingly— shove-off?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione scrutinizes the crate in which Professor Snape's portrait is stored. She makes a wild decision, on par with flying a dragon out of Gringott's.</p>
        
        <p>“I'll hear none of it professor, We're getting you out of here.” She turns to Theo and nods at the box in a firm order, “Theo hurry, take the other end!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione quickly heaves up half of the box while Theo ungracefully shuffles to the other end without objection. Snape objects loudly, “What! NO!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo's mummified head gestures down to the box in his arms and his single eye meets her own, “Where are we taking him?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione ponders this. “Erm— well, that is a good question. I'm afraid that I'm not too sure as of yet… I suppose we could leave him at Hagrid's— for the time being… Until I can have it properly sorted…”</p>
        
        <p>Snape erupts in a fit of wrath, his protests reverberate through the silence. “NO! NO! NO!”</p>
        
        <p>The noises from beyond the door go silent, then a voice asks, “Did you hear that?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione gestures with her nose to the quilt on the floor and whispers to her friend, “Theo I'll hold it, get the cover back on, he doesn't know what's good for him.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo obliges and retrieves the cover from the floor, draping it over the box. Muffled cries sound from beneath. “Cast a muffliato!” Theo minds her orders and finally, silence resumes.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione makes her way to the potions cabinet exit, “There's a staircase— a hidden passage. It's Behind Slughorn's desk, hurry!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore, an ever-appeasing accomplice, follows her lead as they sidestep out of the cabinet, across the potions classroom, and to the door behind Slughorn's desk. With a wandless Alohomora, she unlocks it effortlessly, earning an impressed quirk of Theo's only visible brow.</p>
        
        <p>They step into a dimly lit stairwell, its steps winding into darkness. Behind them, the door slams shut with a resounding boom, causing the walls to tremble. Dust and debris fill the air, leaving both Hermione and Theo coughing through the clouds of it. When they recover, and the dust clears, they stand there, at the foot of the stairs, peering upward into the doom beyond.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione can't help but feel like Frodo, with her own loyal — albeit slightly mangled— Sam at her side, embarking on the Pass of Cirith Ungol, bearing the weight of… Hermione stops herself. There is no way she will be equating Professor Severus Snape's Portrait to ‘The One Ring to Rule Them All'.</p>
        
        <p>They commence their ascent up the spiral stairs. For countless moments, their ragged breaths are the only sounds echoing through the tower. It's pitch black and the combination of the weight of the box and the difficult uphill climb has Hermione collapsing against the stone wall.</p>
        
        <p>“We need to stop a moment, It's so dark. I can't see a thing!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione heaves a few breaths against the stone when she begins to feel the sensation of something crawling on her shoulder. She screams, dropping the box. It tumbles a few steps before Theo readjusts his hold. When he opens his mouth to ask what happened, a blinding light beams forth. And in the brilliant illumination, hundreds upon thousands of spiders on the walls, floor, and ceiling, shrink back into their crevices. All Hermione's brain can register is that Theo's teeth are most definitely The Phial of Galadriel.</p>
        
        <p>“Theo, your teeth! Keep your mouth open! It's the Twinkling Teeth, you can light the way!”</p>
        
        <p>Eager to oblige and get the hell out, Theo continues bearing his teeth effectively lighting up the stairwell.</p>
        
        <p>After what seems like a hundred steps Theo finally moans, “How… many… bloody…steps… are there??”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione bites her lip, “Well, we were in the dungeons… This tower is similar to the one near the divinations class, so the first exit should be on the sixth floor.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo releases an exasperated sound and begins muttering under his breath about “damn staircases”, his “bloody eye” and the like. Hermione's legs are shaking from the ascent until finally, they reach the sixth floor. They both fling themselves out of the dusty staircase with heaving breaths.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione groans, “Never… climbing a staircase…ever…. Again”</p>
        
        <p>Theo drops to the floor and rests his back against the wall, reaches into his robes, and takes out a blue vial, “Here, we can share.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo hands the vial to Hermione and she takes a place next to him against the wall. Unstopping the vial, she takes a few sips and when she is feels sated, hands the rest off to Theo. Immediately the effects begin working. Hermione notices the intensity isn't as overpowering as it was the last time she took it, most likely due to the smaller dosage, but the bubbling laughter is still prominent.</p>
        
        <p>In her haze, she has a fuzzy realisation, “Theo, we didn't use a featherlight charm.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo raises his fists to the heavens and begins pumping ferociously, “GAAAHH!”</p>
        
        <p>The eruption climbs up her throat, collecting behind her closed lips, until finally it pops. Spittle and peels of mirth bound from her lips and all over the side of Theo's unbandaged face. There are a few moments when he just stares at her in shock. Hermione's mortification rises to her cheeks and she can feel them staining red. Finally, he ends the stiff silence and bursts into manic laughter. He descends to the floor, falling onto his side, and clutches at his stomach, heaving and choking on air, all while rays of light burst forth. It is all just so ridiculous, preposterous, and contagious. Tears fall from Hermione's eyes from the gaiety of the moment, and also from re-discovering the joy she thought her shriveled heart would never again experience. Theo; the nearly blind, havoc-creating, luminescent wizard, is the best thing that has happened to her in a very long time. In this moment, she has a sudden realization: for her friend, Theodore, she would gladly ascend every staircase in Hogwarts, and would certainly scale Mordor's loftiest peak. The following few moments are spent in euphoric delight before they simultaneously decide, “Onward!”</p>
        
        <p>Sharing the weight of the box between them, Hermione and Theo snake down the corridor in erratic steps, winding to the left, then to the far right. On their unsteady course, Theo trips over his lanky legs and collides with a pillar. The crate slips from their combined grasp and sends Professor Snape's portrait skidding across the floor until it finally comes to rest, face-down on the stone. There are muffled shouts and Hermione, tearful from laughter, peels the portrait from the floor on unsteady feet.</p>
        
        <p>“You blithering idiots! Put me back!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione leans down on her haunches and begins attempting to soothe the portrait, “Sorry professor, please quiet down. I promise to take you back out when we get to Hagrid's! I'll even hang you on the wall! I'm sure Hagrid would love the company….” A flurry of “NO's” erupt forth. She re-directs her attention back to Theo, hastily gesturing to him, “Theo! Hurry! Place the cover back on, shut him up, please.”</p>
        
        <p>“SHUT ME UP?? YOU DAFT, IMPUDENT, CRETIN, I WILL HAVE YOU BY THE —.”</p>
        
        <p>Snape is quickly shut up when Theo drops the cover back into place.</p>
        
        <p>“Thank Merlin! Come on, let's go…. I believe we're somewhere near the Divination tower, it should be one floor above… I think if we head straight down this corridor it should take us to the staircase and we can make our way to the —."</p>
        
        <p>Hermione stops in her tracks. At the other end of the hall, approaching swiftly is Professor Slughorn. She swallows. Theo, the merry deformed-looking fool, leans down to her ear and whispers placidly, “It's alright, he won't notice.”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione peeks a glance down the hall at the approaching professor and then at the box in their shared arms. Written on the side facing Slughorn are the words:</p>
        
        <p><i>Property of Horace Slughorn</i></p>
        <p><i>Do Not Remove From Potion's Cabinet</i></p>
        
        <p>Hermione blanches, “OH GOD, THEO!” With a violent shove the crate is out of her arms and into Theo's, “Hurry get rid of it!! I'll distract him!” She dashes toward Professor Slughorn in several movements made of skips, hops, and a brisk jog. Slughorn is not prepared for the onslaught when she finally greets him.</p>
        
        <p>“Professor! Lovely day, wouldn't you agree?…” She smiles up at the plump, red-cheeked man.</p>
        
        <p>Professor Slughorn greets her with merriment, “Oh! What a pleasant surprise! Ms. Granger, what brings you to the sixth floor?”</p>
        
        <p>“Oh erm…” she searches frantically for a viable excuse, “The—the statues! Yes! The statues on this floor are quite fascinating, here take a look!” She shoves Professor Slughorn in the direction of a disheveled knight who leans aslant against a stone pillar. Dust and cobwebs litter its lacklustre surface.</p>
        
        <p>“Here, Professor. You must take a gander at the details! It is so— stimulating! The artistry and…. the details… Yes! Quite riveting, wouldn't you agree?!”</p>
        
        <p>She manhandles him roughly, jostling him every few seconds, forcing him to survey the knight from a new and exciting angle. His potbelly stomach brushes against the figurine, transferring a streak of ancient dust onto his waistcoat. To her relief, he takes the bait, leaning in closely to inspect the dilapidated armour.</p>
        
        <p>“Quite right, Ms. Granger! Fine craftsmanship it is! I'd go on to say there is nary a rival amongst its kind! A keen eye, Ms. Granger!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione takes a peek back at Theo, who now, to her consolation, is noticeably box-less. Thank heavens! Slughorn is still examining the figure when Hermione quickly plans her escape.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, Professor! I really must be on my way. It was lovely speaking with you!” She rounds in a 365-degree turn and briskly walks away. In her departure, she hears the professor hum another, “Indeed!”</p>
        
        <p>Returning to Theo, she grabs him by the elbow and heaves a sigh of relief, “Well, that was—close… Too close… Where's the box?”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore's expression is blank. “What box?”</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, the potion's effects wane, whilst her agitation rises. “Theodore…The box containing our former professor's sentient portrait, where is it?”</p>
        
        <p>He supplies a curt laugh, “Oh, ha! Yes, that one…Ha well..” His voice lowers to a quiet mumble, “ithrewta wenoh”</p>
        
        <p>“Theo what are you saying I can't understand your mumbling”</p>
        
        <p>Theo opens his mouth to repeat himself just as a piercing cry pierces the air. Frantic pleas for help ensue, it appears to be coming from outside. Hermione rushes toward the window and gasps at the scene below. On the top of the hillside below Padma or… Pavarti?— Some Patil or another, leans over a prone body, shrieking—Definitely Pavarti. A wooden box, seemingly empty and on its side lies a few feet away. Several floors below a dark, thick garment hangs listlessly on a gargoyle. Hermione's heart seizes. Pavarti shifts, revealing a motionless body on the ground, and Bloody shite of all holy hell… The pale form of Draco Malfoy lies prone in the grass. Theo finally dares to join her, and peers out of the window toward the havoc below.</p>
        
        <p>He gasps. “Oh, fuck. I'm dead!”</p>
        
        <p>“You're dead??? He looks like the dead one Theo!”</p>
        
        <p>“FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” He begins ripping into his hair, pulling the strands maniacally, the action unfurling the bandage covering his eye.</p>
        
        <p>“You killed your best friend!” Hermione pales, turns to face him, and cups her mouth.</p>
        
        <p>“OH, GOD THEO… YOUR LOVER!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo looks like he's been struck, one eye is wide in terror while the other is glued shut from the swelling, “He's not my lover you twat! He loves me, it's not reciprocal! FUUCK!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione scrubs at her face, “Merlin, that's even worse!”</p>
        
        <p>One eye is a saucer, “What have I done!?”</p>
        
        <h2>ATTEMPTED MURDER OF EX-DEATH EATER DRACO MALFOY AT HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY</h2>
        <h3>By Rita Skeeter</h3>
        
        <p>Former Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, the prized fledgling of He-Who-Must-not-Be-Named; Pawn in the meticulously plotted murder of Albus Dumbledore; The Slytherin Prince, was found unconscious in a presumed case of attempted murder at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, on the evening of September 15th, 1998.</p>
        
        <p>Evidence surrounding the crime scene suggests he was brutally attacked by the portrait of former headmaster and long-time potions professor, Severus Snape.</p>
        
        <p>The portrait had reportedly struck the head of the ex-death eater Draco Malfoy with considerable force, leaving the victim in a state of comatose, before tumbling down an embankment and into the black lake. Several hours later it was retrieved from the depths by Aurors when numerous students residing in the dungeons had reported seeing the portrait being inappropriately handled by the lake's resident selkies. A witness, fourth-year Slytherin, Rory McFarland, recounts his story of the event:</p>
        
        <p>“There I was, minding my ain business, finishing aff the last o' the liquorice Wands my gran had sent me, when I glanced out the windae and saw somethin' that fair took my breath away! Headmaster Severus Snape was in a right peculiar position, never seen such angles and pasitions, he was being forced tae—.”</p>
        
        <p>The Graphic details of the incident have been determined unsuitable for general audiences. If you'd like the full account please turn to page 7 and remove enchantments on the page…</p>
        
        <p>News of this incident emerges mere months after Draco Malfoy purportedly refused the custodianship of the portrait. An anonymous source, with ties to the inner circles within Hogwarts, confirms that the portrait had been offered to the Malfoy's by the Hogwarts Board of Governors in response to the portrait's specific request to reside at Malfoy Manor. It was public knowledge that the deceased, Severus Snape, was Godfather and mentor to Draco Malfoy. Some question the possibility of unresolved animosity between the two.</p>
        
        <p>Why would Draco Malfoy refuse care of his former Godfather's portrait? Were hatchets not buried with the former Headmaster? The speculations of retributive justice by the portrait itself have been called into question.</p>
        
        <p>The head Curator for the Restoration and Maintenance of Magical Art and Relics at the Ministry of Magic accounts the probability of such an incident:</p>
        
        <p>“It is very unlikely that an enchanted portrait would aspire to machinations such as devising and attempting murder. Even less likely is that such an ambition be fueled on the grounds of vengeance. The success of such a scheme would likely require the assistance of a witch or wizard as an accessory. It is not in a portrait's nature to manipulate witches and wizards to do their bidding, except in cases of extreme threat to the portrait's livelihood or if such impulses were ‘written into' the painting, by the artist.”</p>
        
        <p>It begs the question of exactly who was involved in the schemes of Portrait Severus Snape. What were his motives? Who was an accomplice?</p>
        
        <p>The portrait of Severus Snape is currently undergoing a restorative process after spending several hours at the bottom of the Black Lake, deeming it unavailable for questioning. However, an eyewitness, Pavarti Patil, currently a student at Hogwarts and a former member of the student-led militia group Dumbledore's Army, shares her account of the events:</p>
        
        <p>“It was dreadful! I was on my evening stroll, when all of a sudden, something came hurtling out of the sky. I tried to warn him! I told him to look out, but he only sneered at me like I had gone mad! The next moment, the corner of the frame struck Malfoy atop the head and all I could see was the scowling bust of Professor Snape flying past. The portrait ricocheted off Malfoy's head, sped down the steep hill, and splashed into the dark lake. It happened so fast! By the time I looked back, Malfoy was lying on the grass, unconscious. I was in shock! All I could manage to do was to scream, and that's precisely what I did.”</p>
        
        <p>As we await the Auror's investigation to uncover the truth behind what really transpired, we're left with some questions of our own...</p>
        
        <p>Who conspired with the Portrait of Severus Snape to attack Ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy?</p>
        
        <p>What tensions simmer between Draco Malfoy and his peers?</p>
        
        <p>Who would want Draco Malfoy dead?</p>

            <h2>Ligatus</h2>
            <div>
                <p>“Hi. Erm— I'm Junior Auror, Harry Potter.”</p>

<p>Harry lifts his hand to the crowd in a hesitant wave. The throng of gathered students comprised of prefects and the entire house of Phoenix stare unimpressed at their former classmate aka, the Hero of the Wizarding World. Shuffling on his feet nervously, Harry focuses his attention down to his parchment, clears his throat and begins reading softly, word for word.</p>

<p>“I am here of behalf of the Ministry for Magic, with the investigation of the case regarding a recent attack—.”</p>

<p>There's a shout from somewhere in the crowd. “Speak up! We can't hear you!”</p>

<p>A red blotch appears on Harry's neck and blooms upward. He nervously reaches his hand up to scratch at his head, when he removes it, a portion of hair stands on end. Hermione finds herself fighting the overwhelming impulse to rush the platform and flatten it back into submission. Harry has never been one for elaborate speeches or ornate diatribes, he's a man born of action. His life has been formed by what he does, rather than says. One does not kill a Basilisk, fight off a hoard of dementors, or defeat the Wizarding world's most infamous dark lord by words alone. Hermione pity's him, the entire affair must be agonizing.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry.” Harry retrieves his wand from his robes, and with trembling hands, holds it to his neck, casting a shaky amplifying charm. When he clears his throat, the sound thunders through the room.</p>

<p>“THE INVESTIGATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the gathered crowd instinctively clutch their ears, protecting themselves from the onslaught of noise.</p>

<p>Ginny breaks in and bellows over the clamor. “TOO LOUD YOU MUPPET!”</p>

<p>For several moments, Harry only blinks at Ginny, a mortified expression is plastered across his face. Hermione finally takes pity on her friend and climbs the platform. She helps him to adjust the volume on his charm, pats his hair back into a respectable shape, and retreats back to her place among the horde. Harry gives her a nod of thanks and turns back to address the crowd.</p>

<p>“I apologize for the interruptions. Erm— I'll just go ahead and begin again.” He clears his throat and reattempts his speech.</p>

<p>“I am here on behalf of the Ministry for Magic to investigate the recent attack of a Hogwarts student. The investigation is currently underway. It has been made my job to investigate the possible perpetrator behind the attack. Investigations can last several weeks, and currently, it is not known how long this particular investigation will last... I will be investigating possible suspects by speaking to those close to the victim in order to solve the—Erm— investigation…”</p>

<p>Dean and Seamus, to Hermione's immediate right, rudely and indescreetly have their attention focused at the floor. Hermione's of the sense to knock them upside the head and make them pay attention, when she notices their shoulder's shaking; looking closer she realizes it's an obviously feeble attempt at controlling their laughter. From within the crowd, a hand shoots up. Hermione peers around the heads of several onlookers and connects the owner of said hand to be Blaise Zabini.</p>

<p>“Pardon, my apologies. I am having some difficulties wrapping my head around this. What exactly are you here to do?”</p>

<p>Harry blinks. “I'm here to investigate.”</p>

<p>Hermione peeks a glance at Dean and Seamus again, who seem to have entirely abandoned the activity of breathing, their faces flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>Zabini nods, rubs at his chin, and hums in thought. When Harry opens his mouth to continue his speech, Zabini interrupts again, raising a finger in another query.</p>

<p>“Apologies, again. Another question…What is the official term for this process?”</p>

<p>Harry might be catching on, Hermione is not too sure.</p>

<p>“It's called an… investigation.”</p>

<p>Tears are streaming down Dean and Seamus's faces, which are now the same shade of violet as the Phoenix banner's overhead. A mischievous glint sparkles in Zabini's eyes when he sneaks a glance at the pair, obviously relishing in the game he's playing at. Zabini raises his hand in yet another attempt at inquiry. And suddenly there's a flash of movement on the dais as Ron emerges from behind—Hermione had not even known he was present. He's almost unrecognizable, dressed in a wool, grey, tartan waistcoat and a matching deerstalking cap —concealing the distinct copper of his hair. Ron roughly pushes Harry out of the way, staggers slightly, and grips the podium with one hand while the other aims at the crowd, a long finger pointing directly at Blaise Zabini.</p>

<p>“Oi! Listen here, wanker! Harry's here on important Ministry business, so you'd better listen up or we'll have you dragged off the Azkaban!”</p>

<p>Harry squeezes himself in next to Ron and places a gentle hand to his friend's shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, no Ron. Thanks, but we don't have clearance for that. Also, it's not really what we're here for. We're here to investigate, remember?” He emphasizes this novel information with a pleading look, Ron begrudgingly concedes and turns to readdress the crowd.</p>

<p>“Right. Well, we can't throw you in Azkaban—yet. But alls the same, it would do you best to listen or I'll come after you.”</p>

<p>To Hermione's annoyance, Harry unloads his frustrations onto his hair. “No. No, Ron. We cannot physically threat the students.”</p>

<p>“Oh sorry, listen or we'll take away away house points.”</p>

<p>“Ron! We cannot do that either.”</p>

<p>“Bloody hell, then why are we even here??”</p>

<p>The crowd replies in concert, “To investigate!”</p>

<p>Ron's face flushes the color of his hair and he throws his hands up in defeat. Harry gestures for him to return to his place, presumably far, far, away from the podium. Ron relents and storms off. Harry looks as if he's going to start another speech but to everyone's relief, McGonagall steps in.</p>

<p>“Now that we've been given an overview of what we should expect from the ministries presence here at Hogwarts, prefects, please return to your respective dormitories and update your houses. House of Phoenix, if you would please return to your common room, as your head of house will be conducting a mandatory assembly. Your presence is required, any students who do not report to the House of Phoenix common room will be cited and questioned.”</p>

<p>Hermione swallows. She looks over her shoulder at Theo, who stands in the back of the crowd. A day after the incident, his eye is considerably less puffy, but a purplish green bruise lingers under his eye. At least his teeth have returned to their normal state. He catches her glance and imparts a worried frown. As a whole, Theo looks awful. His robes are disheveled and his hair is greasy and unkept. Hermione's heart throbs. They are the only two who truly know what happened, and its visibly eating Theo alive. They need to strategize. Are they planning to tell the truth or keep a low profile? Over the past day it's been difficult to breathe. Each time her name is said, her body seizes with dread, overcome with the overwhelming fear that someone has figured it all out, has come to interrogate her. She can only imagine what Theo is feeling. When the crowd begins to disperse she aims directly for him with the purpose of sorting it all out. Two steps is all she takes when suddenly, she is waylaid by Harry and Ron.</p>

<p>“Hi.”</p>

<p>“Harry!” Hermione swiftly pulls him in for a tight hug, causing him to wheeze as the air is compressed from his lungs.</p>

<p>Hermione peeks over his shoulder to see Ron who is slowly inching himself away. She reaches for his waistcoat and roughly tugs him into the embrace. They allow her to squeeze them mercilessly and she loves them more for it. Suddenly, she realizes that her eyes are wet, she's crying. The shock of her own tears breaks through her defenses and unbridled emotions well up from deep within, sending her into a fit of sniffs and sobs. Her two loyal friends melt a little further into her embrace, both giving her pacifying pats on the back. Eventually, she pulls away, wipes her tears on her sleeve, and busies herself with inspecting them both.</p>

<p>Hermione's eyes are still red and puffy from tears when she reaches up to straighten Harry's collar and smooth over the rough bit of hair on his head.</p>

<p>“Right, well. Good job Harry. That was all very official.”</p>

<p>Harry smiles sheepishly in response and Hermione swells with pride for her friend. When Harry had first announced he'd taken the ministries offer after the war to train as an Auror, Hermione was ecstatic for him. All news after Voldemort's defeat seemed to add to the jubilee. Bill and Fluer announced their pregnancy, Kingsley became Minister, Harry was given an order of Merlin, along with herself and Ron, and had accepted his offer into the Auror training program. It was all wonderful, until it wasn't…</p>

<p>Hermione redirects her attention toward Ron and his strange attire.</p>

<p>“Now, you….Ronald… What are you wearing?” Ron puffs up his chest and supplies a smug smile.</p>

<p>“You like it?”</p>

<p>“It's very… Victorian… I suppose it's not bad… But why this look, in particular?”</p>

<p>Ron opens his mouth to reply when Harry suddenly breaks in.</p>

<p>“He's been watching The Adventure's of Sherlock Holmes on the telly.”</p>

<p>Hermione releases a small giggle, “Ohh. Yes, that would explain it.”</p>

<p>Ron flushes and furrows his brow at the floor. “Actually, I'm on the Memoirs now…”</p>

<p>“Oh, no Ron. I like it! It suits you. I was just a bit confused. But it does make you look rather smart.”</p>

<p>This seems to brighten Ron up and he returns to proudly puffing up his chest. Harry clears his throat and Hermione turns her attention back to him.</p>

<p>“So, Hermione… Do you know anything? I mean, its mad. The whole thing is unbelievable, someone had to be working with Professor Snape's Portrait. Though, we don't even have the means to properly interrogate it. The portrait has been thoroughly damaged from being at the bottom of the Black Lake for so long and it appears to be abandoned. We asked the other portraits if they've seen Snape, but no one has. Said they'd never spoken to him, even before, when he was hung in McGonagall's office. Apparently he was rude and unsociable. They eventually had to take him down because he wouldn't quit complaining about everything and insulting anyone who passed by. I just don't get it. Why would Snape try to kill Malfoy? And who hates Malfoy enough to want him dead? Have you seen or heard anything we could work with? I've been…”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>Harry's voice is drowned out by the clamorous sounds of her own heart. He's still rabbling and all she can think is STOP STOP STOP. Her vision is swimming, blurring into a hundred fragmented pieces of blinding light, black hair sticking on its ends and scratchy Scottish wool. She wants to run—hide away in some dusty corner of the castle and scream, stomp, cry.</p>

<p>Breathe Hermione.</p>

<p>Deep breaths. One, two, three.</p>

<p>Slowly, she reigns in her panic and begins to register Harry's voice, still rambling on…</p>

<p>“What about him? Theodore Nott, right? He doesn't look too good. Offly suspicious…”</p>

<p>Immediately, Hermione snaps back to the present.</p>

<p>“Theo? No, Theo is not a suspect. Yesterday, he was… He was with me.”</p>

<p>Harry blinks. “Oh.” His brows furrow in thought. “He's your…”</p>

<p>"Friend. Theodore is my friend.” Hermione heaves a breath and looks pleadingly into Harry's eyes. “Harry, He's a good bloke. Plus, he's Malfoy's best friend. He's been completely devastated by all of this. This has all been really hard on him.”</p>

<p>Harry gives an accepting nod, "Right. Well... We'd better head to your new common room then, Ron and I get to join in the fun." He supplies a shrewd wink, filling her with warmth that follows her all the way up to the Phoenix common room.</p>

<p>“Welcome to the Phoenix Common Room A.A. Fellowship! Please take your seat, anywhere will do, we will begin shortly.”</p>

<p>Hermione settles herself in a seat near the girl's dormitory stairs, preparing for a swift exit when things inevitably fall apart. Ginny, seemingly sharing the same sentiment, plops down onto the seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he's referring to.”</p>

<p>“I am silently praying to Merlin that it is not what I think it is.”</p>

<p>“And what—.”</p>

<p>All members of the of Phoenix house appear to be present and situated so Professor NeatWanker begins speaking, depriving Ginny of the opportunity to ask her next question. Professor NeatWanker claims his own seat within the circle, wedging himself between an anguished looking Blaise Zabini and an enthusiastic Neville.</p>

<p>“My name is Blandus NeatWanker… I am a wizard and your secretary… Let us begin with a moment of silence and a plea to the heavens…”</p>

<p>Hermione directs a whisper at Ginny. “Oh God Ginny. It really is…”</p>

<p>“What?? What is it Hermione?”</p>

<p>Dean, a few seats down, ungraciously leans himself over Padma and Pavarti and finally indulges Ginny.</p>

<p>“This, is an A.A. meeting.”</p>

<p>Ginny, who still hasn't found the desired answer to her question, gives Hermione a pleading look.</p>

<p>“What is an A.A. meeting?"</p>

<p>“Well its a worldwide fellowship for alcoholism, famously known as Alcoholics Anonymous or A.A….This meeting seems loosely based on the same design.”</p>

<p>NeatWanker concludes his prayer and begins reciting a twelve step plan for the evening that does not make any sense. No one here is an alcoholic, besides possibly Ron, who has tagged along with Harry in the investigation, and is paying rapt attention to every word out of NeatWanker's mouth. Alright, one alcoholic. Besides that it's just Neville and his worried eyes, a nail picking Ginny who sits next to her, she supposes Theo and his potions could possibly count, begrudgingly she realizes her pill dependency is her own form of addiction.</p>

<p>“I understand some may find this affair to be confusing, as who here could truly call themselves an alcoholic?”</p>

<p>The rhetorical question is answered by a single hand, Ron. Belatedly, Ron realizes his mistake and sinks into his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes very good. Honesty is one of the most noble of qualities young man. Though many here may not deal with alcoholism per say, dependencies, habits and enslavements of the mind can be much more destructive than any substance. To be a slave to resentment, hate, fear, can can the greatest of interior perils. What has occurred to one of our students here at Hogwarts is a tragedy, and could have been prevented. I hope today you will learn a bit about how we can understand each other and find commonalities in our differences. Today, I would like us to begin with honesty…”</p>

<p>Honesty. Professor NeatWanker's voice grows to a distant hum in the back of her mind, she's falling down the rabbit hole of her own thoughts. The truth of the matter is that all of this stems from her. Her request for more of Theo's potion, her insistence on taking that blasted box from the Potion's Room extended cabinet, all because she had commanded Theo to get rid of it, resulting in his throwing it out the window. Her mind drifts back to the last time she'd seen Malfoy, to her parting words.</p>

<p>“One of these days Malfoy…You will get what's coming to you… You won't even know what hit you.”</p>

<p>Her exact words had come to pass.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Guilt rips its way through her, she considers running up the stares, fleeing, knocking down every pill left within her bottle, anything, Anything to make the guilt end. Resolute in her mission to make an indiscreet exit, Hermione covertly looks around, then stills. All eyes are on her.</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>Ginny nudges her with an elbow and lowers to her ear in a soft whisper. “Your name and your personal take on the virtue of honesty.”</p>

<p>Oh. Her eyes fall back down to her lap. It's an easy question. Simple.</p>

<p>“My name is Hermione Granger…. and honesty is…” Thump. Thump. Thump, “Honesty is… It's important because…”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>There's a burst of giggles from a few seats down and Hermione glances over to see a smug looking Tracy Davis.</p>

<p>“Wow, The Hermione Granger at a loss for words. I suppose she's not as brave without pious Potter and weirdo Weasely at her side.”</p>

<p>Ginny's hand jerks toward the pocket she stores her wand in, but Professor NeatWanker is quicker.</p>

<p>“Now, now, remember. This is all about unity, understanding, about treating your fellow classmates with respect. If Ms. Granger does not wish to share this round, she can pass like Ms. Parkinson.” Hermione doesn't meet the professors eyes when she nods, passing the prompt to Ginny.</p>

<p>“Ginny Weasley here. Honesty is crucial because people have the right to know who the slags walking around exactly are." She punctuates this statement by fixing her gaze directly on Davis.</p>

<p>“How dare you!” It's a flash of movement before, Davis and Ginny are both on their feet, brandishing their wands at one another. Professor NeatWanker and Harry rise too, the latter risks speaking in a pacifying tone.</p>

<p>“C'mon, girls. No need to get all riled. Remember what NeatWanker said, it's all about honesty. This is good, getting everything out in the open. You're making strides. Now let's put the bones to rest.”</p>

<p>Ginny's eyes narrow toward Harry, her nostrils flare, her lip twitching ever so slightly in a snarl. She's irate. Hermione makes note to never find herself on the receiving end of such a display.</p>

<p>“Yes… Honesty…everything out in the open…Putting bones to rest… Why, Harry, since you seem to be so knowledgeable in these matters, perhaps you can enlighten us. How, exactly, does ignoring and avoiding your girlfriend for weeks align with the definition of honesty? And please, do tell, how is silently breaking up with her and using the sorry excuse of needing space a noble attempt at being open, honest? What is the honest part about leading her on for years, only to leave her at the first opportunity?”</p>

<p>Oh Merlin. This is really happening, right now. Harry looks as if he's being cornered by a hoard of dementors, with not one happy memory to draw from. He begins stuttering and mumbling unintelligible sounds. There may be an “I” and a few “Erms” possibly a “never” and a “hurt” until finally, a definite “sorry” is coughed up.</p>

<p>An awkward beat of silence ensues until NeatWanker croaks like a frog in the dead of night.</p>

<p>“Please, students, Auror Harry, return to your seats. Honesty is about transparency, first with ourselves and then others. We cannot force others to be honest with us, if they are not first exercising honesty within themselves. Patience and acceptance are the keys to understanding truth.”</p>

<p>NeatWanker casts a furtive glance at Harry, then Ginny.</p>

<p>"Again, there's no pressure for anyone to feel obliged to explain themselves; honesty cannot be coerced.”</p>

<p>Harry swallows and nods at the professor before feebly sinking back into his chair. Ginny exhales a sigh, muttering a “Coward” before firmly resettling herself in her seat.</p>

<p>At the heed of NeatWanker, the session reconvenes and several share their inputs until finally, the turn lands on Neville, who is the last to share before reaching NeatWanker.</p>

<p>The room is tense with anticipation, everyone gathered eagerly awaiting for the ordeal to come to its end. They sit on the edge of their seats, silently urging Neville to hurry it up and get it over with.</p>

<p>“Hi, I'm Neville Longbottom. In my opinion, honesty is like water and a relationship is like a plant. Like water, honesty is necessary for a relationship to prosper, survive. When other's see honesty in action, they are drawn to it, it's necessary for nurturing friendships and cultivating new ones…”</p>

<p>“Yea, Neville. Real nice of you to cultivate friendships with the enemy huh. Like Parkinson. Tell us, you even thinking about spreading your seed?”</p>

<p>Terry Boot's tone is scornful and laced with derision. He's siting back in his chair with his arms crossed, an ankle resting over his knee.</p>

<p>Neville's neck flushes scarlet and his hands flex at his sides.</p>

<p>“I'm not here to hold grudges. Be it Parkinson, Zabini or even Malfoy… They all deserve a second chance. It's a year to show we truly are, Boot.”</p>

<p>Harry perks up from his slumped position, the subject matter broaching on far more intriguing territory. Harry takes his opportunity to leverage the discussion toward his objective.</p>

<p>“Great insights Neville! So why don't we go around the circle and share our thoughts on Malfoy.”</p>

<p>Groans ensue. Whatever Harry assumed would happen next, doesn't.</p>

<p>Zabini: “He's tolerable, on a good day. Best to avoid him the other 360 days of the year.”</p>

<p>Pansy: “No comment.”</p>

<p>Seamus: “In fifth, Prat told me I looked like an advertisement for contraceptive potion. Hated him since. Could've rolled into the bloody lake with that portrait for all I care.”</p>

<p>Bulstrode: “In fourth year he said ‘It's a shame that a freakishly large nose could mar perfectly good lineage.'”</p>

<p>A string of sniffing and whimpering erupt and nearby spectators pat Bulstrode's back sympathetically. The following subsequent minutes morph from “sharing our thoughts on Draco Malfoy” to “Why I, too, hate Draco Malfoy.”</p>

<p>Apparently, a third of the assembly openly harbor animosity toward Malfoy and wish to be rid of him in one way or another. Another third maintain indifference to his presence and actively avoid any circumstances which require them to directly interact with him. Theo, loyal until the end, preserves the last remnant of his degraded character, inciting that he is a “good fellow, underneath it all”. Hermione joins Parkinson in the vague realm of ‘no comment'.</p>

<p>Harry, no nearer to a breakthrough, appears frustrated—his list of potential suspects having somehow, expanded.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>Everyone seems to seize at Luna's curt question. Hermione swallows. Guilt continues twisting it's way up her spine, mocking her while coiling upward.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Harry releases a resigned sigh, “No. He's not dead… Pompey and several healers from St. Mungo's are currently treating him, but he appears to be in a state of prolonged unconsciousness. It's complicated. He's in, what is commonly known as a ‘Vegetative State' by muggles.”</p>

<p>Silence pulses through the room in heavy, dreadful waves, washing out all enmity and leaving only shame in its wake. All eyes sink to the floor, like a moment of silence for the dead. Hermione sinks herself further into her chair. Her spine aches to compress her chest cavity, coil into a ball and roll up the stairs and into her bed.</p>

<p>A clap splits the silence and all eyes aimed at the floor flit to Professor NeatWanker, who stands with clasped hands.</p>

<p>“I think that's all for tonight, folks.”</p>

<p>Chairs scape against stone as all the students silently rise and retreat up the stairs to their respective dorms. Hermione does not move. She casts a glance at Theo, who, along with herself, is of the last remaining seated. Bodies move around him in their retreat, but he continues to sit quietly, staring dejectedly at the floor. Brown hair falls messily over his eyes and his hands are balled into fists in his lap. A blotch of crimson hovers in her periphery so she pivots to face Ginny.</p>

<p>“Come on. Lets go up?”</p>

<p>“I will be up in in a bit. I need to talk to Theo.”</p>

<p>Ginny nods and offers Hermione a gentle hug. Hermione catches Harry's eyes over Ginny's shoulder as she is pulled into the embrace. His eyes linger on Ginny as she gingerly pulls away and makes her way up the stairs. Hermione swore to herself she wouldn't get in the middle of whatever is happening between her two friends, she loves them both too much. However, watching them suffer and slowly fall apart, is agonizing. If they could only see how much they mean to one another…</p>

<p>Hermione continues to watch as Harry defeatedly drops his gaze to the floor while Ginny disappears up the stairs. Theo approaches him then, seemingly pulling him from his stupor. What is Theo up to? Her curiosity eats at her as they share several words before finally, Harry nods to him and Theo's spirits seem to bolster. Hermione catches Theo's eyes as he departs from Harry, delivering her a subtle quirk of his head, toward the common room exit. He is most definitely up to something.</p>

<p>Hermione joins Harry and Ron, accompanying them towards the exit of the common room. She offers them both a final hug, then watches as they leave through the door. After waiting a few moments to ensure they are gone, she follows suit. The corridor is silent, the click of her shoes the only sound as she makes her way down the hall. Where is he? She can't stifle the yelp that escapes her lips as she is suddenly pulled into a dark alcove.</p>

<p>“Theodore!”</p>

<p>“Shh. We're not supposed to be out of the dorms.”</p>

<p>“Then what are we doing out here?”</p>

<p>“I asked Harry and he's allowed us to go, but we still can't be seen by anyone else.”</p>

<p>“And where are we going, Theodore?”</p>

<p>“To see Draco.”</p>

<p>Hermione regards the sight of Malfoy's still form on the small infirmary bed. The bed is small, nearly too small to fit his entire frame. He lays there, rigid and tense, covered in a thin, scratchy sheet that drapes over the lower half of his body. She immediately regrets coming. Seeing Draco Malfoy— her childhood bully, the man who watched as she was tortured on his drawing room floor, the prat who can, at any given moment, effortlessly snake his way under her skin—like this; feels wrong.</p>

<p>Hermione would have never imagined she had any particular expectations regarding Draco Malfoy's behavior or conduct, given his character. Insulting her (and others), threatening or hexing those who get in his way, manipulation, torture… All of it, falls under her umbrella of, “The expected behaviours of a one Draco Malfoy”. In a very strange and twisted way, these expectation comfort Hermione; they are reliable. Although, the Draco Malfoy lying before her is not the same man; he is exposed, powerless, and vulnerable. It's unnerving.</p>

<p>The Malfoy before her is donned in white infamary robes, far from the usual oxfords she's used to seeing. His arms are exposed, revealing a fading dark mark on his left forearm. She releases a shaky breath. Unnerving doesn't quite capture the feeling of the situation, It's indecent. Her discomfort peaks when she finally gathers the courage to glance at his face. Fine, white-blonde hair falls delicately across his forehead. The cheeks of his face are gaunt and shallow, his skin paler than she has ever seen before. A bandage rests at his temple, concealing the expanse of skin where he was struck.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Hermione swallows. The faint lines between his brows and at the corners of his mouth are the only indicators that his expression is typically adorned by a perpetual scowl. Though now, with the scowl quelled, he appears so young, so… peaceful…</p>

<p>Hermione tilts her head, having never before noticed the elegant slope of his nose, the artistic proportions of sharp lines to soft skin. His lips, usually kept in a pinched line are relaxed, gentle, pursed.</p>

<p>Theo's voice splinters the solemn vigil, “I've never seen him like this…”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately straightens up and tucks her hair behind her ear, attempting to conceal the fact that she was just staring at Draco Malfoy while he lay unconscious, “Are you alright?”</p>

<p>“I'll be fine.” Theo takes a seat on the chair at Malfoy's bedside and runs his hands through his hair. “I don't know how this has happened Hermione. I don't know what I was thinking. Fuck. I fucking murdered him.”</p>

<p>“Theo… He's not dead. He's only unconscious. They will heal him, and he'll be back to his usual prat-like self in no time.”</p>

<p>“You heard them, he's not responding to any of their treatments, he's in a ‘vegetative state' as they put it. Nothing is working..”</p>

<p>“It has been one day, Theo.”</p>

<p>Hermione takes Theo's hand in hers and gently rubs her thumb across the back. She wishes she could help, wishes she could alleviate the guilt he feels. But she knows she can't; she is helpless to quell her own. They sit there in silence for many moments until finally, he releases his hand from hers and solemnly pats her own.</p>

<p>“I need to… Narcissa asked that I put this on him.”</p>

<p>Theo reaches into the pocket of his robes and withdraws a long silver chain adorned with an onyx stone. He holds it in his hand, lightly brushing his finger over it. Hermione watches as it glimmers ever so slightly.</p>

<p>“Would you help me?”</p>

<p>She continues to stare at the stone, it's captivating. Theo offers it to her and she takes it into her hand, inspecting it greedily. Hermione has always had a penchant for enchanted objects. When infused with magic, an item undergoes a transformation from its original function, and its potential uses become boundless. The uses of a teakettle may be limited in the muggle world, but once enchanted with magic... The teakettle can transform into an international Portkey to Brazil, or be cursed to sicken anyone who pours a cup of tea from it, or be defiled to hold a piece of a man's soul. Hermione wonders whether the object in her hand is infused with any dark magic, whatever kind it be, it's undoubtedly powerful.</p>

<p>The stone is an emerald cut, approximately the size of the top of her pinky. Upon closer examination, she discerns it is not entirely black, but a shade of green so dark that its exact color can only be revealed through close inspection. The magic is palpable and eager, seemingly receptive to her touch, emanating radiant pulses as she delicately sweeps her fingers over its surface.</p>

<p> Still captivated by the stone, she silently questions Theo. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“It's a protective stone, meant to safeguard those who wear it. A black family heirloom imbued with very old, ancient magic.”</p>

<p>Hermione finally breaks her mesmerized trance and looks up to find Theo regarding her with an odd expression. “Narcissa entrusted me with it, to… to put it on him.”</p>

<p>Her attention returns to the stone in her hands, then briefly flicks to Malfoy, helpless in the infirmary bed. Not for him, but for Theodore.</p>

<p>“Okay, Theo. I'll help you.”</p>

<p>A small, grateful expression passes over his face. Doesn't he already know she could never deny him this? That she would do anything in this moment to help? Anything to quell the despair which currently possesses him? The familiar string of guilt resumes its winding up her spine.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Theo rises and leans over the bed, snaking his arm under Malfoy's neck. She surmises he is leaning down to hug his friend, but in one swift motion, he heaves Malfoy into an upright position. Malfoy's limp body complies, his head lulling to the side and onto Theo's shoulder. Theo grunts from the dead weight of his friend.</p>

<p>“Alright quick, put it on him.”</p>

<p> Hermione blanches. “What? Me?”</p>

<p> Theo huffs in response. “Well obviously. Unless you want to hold him up instead?”</p>

<p> He lifts a brow in her direction and Hermione reluctantly approaches the bedside. Her fingers shake in her attempt to undo the clasp of the necklace. Several moments pass before she successfully frees it. She leans towards Malfoy, attempting to reach for his neck, but damned Theo is in the way, making it a difficult endeavor. The entire situation is awkward, the angle even more-so. Her arms stretch to their limits and in her feeble attempt, she unintentionally bumps into Theo, eliciting an annoyed grunt from him. </p>

<p>“I can't hold him up properly when your shoving at me like that.”</p>

<p> Hermione releases a frustrated huff. “He's too far. I can't quite reach his neck with you in the middle.”</p>

<p>"Just... just move to the other side of the bed."</p>

<p>Hermione nods reluctantly and moves to the other side of the bed. Theo tilts Malfoy's body slightly towards her, intensifying the discomfort of the ordeal. Apart from their incident with the papers, she's never been this close to Malfoy, and now she has to touch him, his neck of all places. Hermione buries those futile thoughts and focuses. All she has to do is clasp the necklace; it is simple, clinical. She steels herself with all the self assurance she can muster. You can do this. However, a faint bell tolls in the back of her mind, like Daedalus warning Icarus on his flight.</p>

<p>She reaches her arm around Malfoy, steadying the necklace in place as she attempts to join the other end. While fumbling to secure the clasp, her fingers lightly brush against the nape of his neck. As Theo had mentioned, the necklace is ancient and appears reluctant to be re-clasped.</p>

<p>“You need to recite an incantation.”</p>

<p>She startles, allowing the necklace to slip from her grasp and fall to the bed.</p>

<p>“What?? No Theo, I can't.”</p>

<p>He brushes her off, nudging Malfoy a little closer in a failed attempt at encouragement.</p>

<p>“It's simple, just repeat after me…Custodiosempra.”</p>

<p>Hermione winces, already aware that the hole she's in was dug by her own, bare hands,“Custodiosempra.”</p>

<p>“Okay, now, Legarementum omni.”</p>

<p>Her heart begins pounding loudly in her chest. “Le…. Legrementum omni.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You have to repeat exactly as I do, or it won't work, now again.”</p>

<p>Hermione follows Theo's directions until finally, she is able to recite the entire incantation on her own.</p>

<p>“Custodiosempra. Legarementum omni, vasis infusumo. Fidelius totalementi, Ligatus Totales.”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>The moment she finishes, the stone pulses in her hand, and a bright beam of light rises to the surface before retreating back into the dark depths of the stone. Immediately, the clasp secures itself around Malfoy's neck, and the chain, still within her grasp, radiates warmth.</p>

<p>Hermione releases it and steps back.</p>

<p>“So…It's done then?”</p>

<p>She watches as Theo delicately rests Malfoy's body back down onto the mattress. It squeaks as he pulls away and moves to stand at her side</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>Side by side, they silently regard Malfoy, who lies peacefully in the bed. Hermione's gaze flits to the necklace now adorning Malfoy's chest. It looks plain now, all magic and power withdrawn into the dark abyss of the stone.</p>

<p>They remain there for several moments, staring at him in the same way they had when they first arrived. However, now—something feels different, strange. Hermione has the sense that some small, subtle change has occurred. An unfolding.</p>

<p>The nameless feeling follows her all the way back to the Phoenix common room, up the stairs, to her room, and into her bed. She cannot ignore the indistinct feeling that she, like Icarus, had somehow flown too close to the sun and now finds herself falling into the abyss.</p>
