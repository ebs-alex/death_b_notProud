            <h2> To The Gallows</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Fog… fog everywhere… fog obscuring her vision, dampening her lungs, gathering on the fine hairs of her neck and cheek. Fog assaulting her senses, distorting the hustle and bustle that surrounds her, and leaving the taste of salt and soot on her tongue.</p>

                <p>Birthed by the Atlantic, ferried by the Thames, fog shrouds the scene of Platform 9 ¾ like a somber veil.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione Granger finds herself suddenly struck with an affection for Charles Dickens; never before has she had any particular affinity for the lengthy prose detailing the dreary, oppressive fog as done so in <i>Bleak House</i>. Though now, for the first time, she fully comprehends its significance.</p>
            
                <p>The fog— thick and stagnant— looms eerily over the platform with a suffocating presence. Yet, this does little to hinder the bustling crowd; the platform is busier than ever. Families rush past, mothers chasing after their children with final attempts at nagging their young. Packs of students, donned in black robes scurry past, caught up in enthusiastic susurrations. Boys and girls lean out from the train windows shouting over the din, while parents look on- tears welling in their eyes.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione appears to be the only one taken captive by the thick fog which encapsulates the platform and the rain-soaked muck and grime which litters the stone. Though she intends to step forward, apprehension sets in, halting her. She could blame it on the onslaught to her senses—the overwhelming amalgamation of fog and commotion— that sends her into a state of paralysis. But in reality, it is the anxiety creeping up her spine and the ominous foreboding that such fog denotes.</p>
            
                <p>In her momentarily lapse of cognizance, she is shoved from behind.</p>
            
                <p>“Ger out the way!” Someone, somewhere yells. She thinks...</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is not quite sure and couldn't be bothered to care. The pounding in her head is making everything hazy and muddled. It's all too overwhelming. She begins to question whether her decision to return is a sensible one.</p>
            
                <p>She reminds herself: Deep breaths. One. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>In an attempt to calm her thoughts, she draws her attention to the skies, wherein she witnesses a most repugnant union: billows of heavy smoke loft from the smokestack of the train, mixing, fusing, and coagulating with droplets of rain, until all that meets earth is damp, mildewed soot.</p>
            
                <p>Definitely not helping.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's diverts her gaze, this time more frantically, searching for any distraction from the anxiety creeping its way under her skin.</p>
            
                <p>She focuses ahead, on a bundle of wet trunks stacked the height of three men. It leans precariously to the right, looming toward the ground like a melancholic Tower of Pisa. Directly beneath this impending doom, stands an old hag, who reaches up, and pinches the cheeks of a grown man. The hag is bent so far backward that it appears her spine may just snap in half. Hermione narrows her attention to the unfortunate man in her company.</p>
            
                <p>Neville?</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's unintended perusing catches his attention. His gaze snaps up, and his expression of raw concern sends her anxiety rocketing to new heights. Neville has always possessed an unusually abundant amount of nurturing instincts, tending to his friends as he does his plants. However, since the end of the war, his caring disposition has only seemed to intensify, making him insufferable company.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally rejoices at the fact that he is not close enough to witness her panic, and satisfies the situation by acknowledging him with a slight tip to her chin.</p>
            
                <p>Yes, Neville. All is well.</p>
            
                <p>Oblivious to her internal struggle, Neville offers a half-smile in return. However, his grandmother— the hag— seems to take notice of the gesture and twirls to face Hermione with unnatural speed. Her crimson spectacles slide a fraction lower on her nose as she unleashes a glare rivaling that of the entire ancestry of the Sacred 28. Duly noted. Perhaps Neville's Grandmother should be dispatched upon the arrival of the next dark lord, the glare alone would do.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione returns her attention to the train.</p>
            
                <p>One Breath. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>Without any warning, she suddenly breaks into panic. Fumbling for her beaded bag, she urgently pries it open.</p>
            
                <p>Where are they? Did she pack them? How did she forget? She has to go back. Just to check.</p>
            
                <p>In her mania, a gentle hand reaches out to grasp her arm, “Hermione.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry? What is it? I forgot something... Oh, bother. I need to go back, I forgot. I need-”</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, look at me,” he demands.</p>
            
                <p>His voice is calm and focused, but her hand does not relent its frantic rummaging through her bag. Suddenly, her fingers catch on a pouch and she sifts her fingers through the contents within.</p>
            
                <p>One. Two bottles. Yes, they're here.</p>
            
                <p>Her sigh of relief is palpable.</p>
            
                <p>“I knew you had what you were looking for. Take a breather, alright?”</p>
            
                <p>Finally, she looks up at Harry. His brows are furrowed, his gaze darting from her bag and then back to her face.</p>
            
                <p>Does he know?</p>
            
                <p>She banishes the thought, there is really nothing he can do. He's done enough. She allows her attention to zero in on what he can control, his soiled spectacles.</p>
            
                <p>Some things will never change.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione reaches up, removes them from his face, and taking the hem of her blouse between her fingertips, polishes them gently.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. You're right. It'll all be alright. I have everything I need, thank you.” She tries to put strength in her words, but they still sound weak.</p>
            
                <p>“I'm an owl away Hermione, don't forget it. You'll have Ginny, too. Ron and I wish you would stay, but I know the N.E.W.T.S., they're- erm, well I know how important they are to you. Ron and I will be here if you need anything... Please, just don't be a stranger, send an owl once in a while.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. Thanks, I will.” She offers a placating smile.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione wants to go on and say he should come too, that he needs to face it alongside her. He needs to find some kind of closure, Auror training will be there when they return. She wants to voice that Ron should be here too; that he should be with his friends, and needs something other than Firewhisky to help him cope.</p>
            
                <p>She wants to say that she's only going because she needs this. Maybe everything: all her anxiety, panic attacks, her addiction will end if she just faces the place where it all began. Her heart is aching to voice that if they can do this together like they always do, maybe everything will just be alright. They have a better chance together, they always have.</p>
            
                <p>Though, she doesn't say any of it. Instead, she places a small kiss to his cheek, pulls him into a hug, and makes her way toward the sound of the blowing whistle.</p>
            
                <p>Onwards, solider.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione peers over her shoulder one last time and notices Harry shifting on his feet nervously. His gaze is fixed on an empty bench, just to the right.</p>
            
                <p>“Harry... Go find Gin. Just-- don't leave without a goodbye. She doesn't deserve that...”</p>
            
                <p>Harry nods and his eyes look a bit clearer when he steps back from the train. Another nod, and he widens the distance between them. The motion marks the first moment the chasm divides them. Her heart aches in her chest. They stare at each other for another moment, until finally, Harry swiftly turns on his heels and rushes off to find Ginny. Hermione watches him depart, then, tucking a stray hair behind her ear, turns to face the carriage.</p>
            
                <p>Billowing smoke, soggy soot. Fog.</p>
            
                <p>Deep breaths. One, Two.</p>
            
                <p>One little step, another makes two. And up she goes, toward doom's impending beak.</p>
            
                <p>“So gently you came rapping,</p>
            
                <blockquote>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door”</blockquote>
            
                <p>The Raven, Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
            
                <p>On the train, the bustling sounds associated with imminent departure envelope the air. Trunks thud against panels, raucous hollering, and shrill laughter emanate from every direction as owls and familiars hoot and squeal over the din.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! A door shuts a few meters ahead.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! Two first-years giggle while tussling with a compartment door; opening and closing it repeatedly.</p>
            
                <p>It's too much.</p>
            
                <p>Further along the corridor, a playful quarrel erupts. A young boy wedges himself between a door, laughing uncontrollably, while a girl inside the compartment emits a playful shriek, trying to keep him out. The boy, donned in dress shoes, struggles to find traction on the wooden floor. He slips and slides on the polished wood, accidentally banging his foot against the wall panel- over and over again.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! More hollering. Screeching. Laughing.</p>
            
                <p>“Let me in Peggie!”</p>
            
                <p>Snickering. And cackling.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>“Little mud-blood”.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>In her haze, she scrambles for her wand, about to cast a hasty <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>, when jet-black hair catches the corner of her eye.</p>
            
                <p>No. It can't be.</p>
            
                <p>Then suddenly, two familiar eyes meet her own, for the second time that day. Neville. She's already aware he can see the mania plastered across her face, and there's no way she can hide it. With no other option, she turns on her heel and flees down the corridor in the opposite direction. In her haste, she accidentally runs into a young boy.</p>
            
                <p>“Sorry.” Their gazes lock briefly, she can tell the moment that it all clicks in his head, when he realizes he's just collided with the Hermione Granger. The reaction is always the same – eyes wide, mouth agape— it's maddening.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione!” Neville's voice cuts through the chaos. “Hermione, come back!”</p>
            
                <p>Without a second thought, she pushes past the boy and scrambles into the next train carriage. She doesn't look back once as she crosses the corridor into the third and then the fourth carriage. Finally, the overwhelming sounds begin to fade and discreetly slips into an empty compartment. Collapsing onto the bench, she lets out a heavy breath, and her hands reach up to cup her face. She inhales deeply. It's on the exhale when everything within her shatters. The sobs emerge. They convulse through her body, jerking her shoulder in erratic spasms. Her hands tremble as she holds her face, trying to suppress the wails she has no control over. Hermione slumps further into her hands. Three more sobs are all she allows.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>Gradually she lifts her chin and focuses on her measured, deep breaths.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>One last heavy sigh and she regains control of herself. She wipes her eyes, and nose, and collects the remnants of her tears with her sleeves. She heaves another glorious breath.</p>
            
                <p>Come off it, Hermione. You won a war for Goodrick's sake.</p>
            
                <p>There is a blaring of the whistle and a sudden jerk of the train as it shifts into motion. Hermione reaches into her beaded bag and locates the pouch she so treasures. Unfastening the clasp, she eyes the two vials: amitriptyline a muggle antidepressant, and diazepam. She has already taken her morning dose of both, but she needs another.</p>
            
                <p>It's just all too much.</p>
            
                <p>She discreetly slips a pill into her palm and gathers enough saliva for a swallow. Just as she raises her hand to her mouth and tilts her head back to swallow the pill, the compartment door jerks open. In a swift movement, she swallows sharply, forcing the pill down. Down. Hastily, she fumbles the lid back onto the vial and stows the evidence back into her beaded bag. Hermione stares at the ground for a few moments, until finally she tucks her hair behind her ear and raises her eyes to the intruder.</p>
            
                <p>“Well Hello, Granger”</p>
            
                <p>“Nott”</p>
            
                <p>Theodore Nott's lanky figure is angled languidly against the doorframe. His robes are pristine, tailored perfectly to his form. His hair coils around his face, framing it with a messy, tousled look. Full lips quirk menacingly as he gazes at her with a sardonic twinkle in his brown eyes.</p>
            
                <p>“My, my Granger. What do we have here?”</p>
            
                <p>“Carry on, Nott this compartment is full.” His eyes glint with mischief.</p>
            
                <p>“And I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be selfless... Although, I suppose Athena has paid the price for an entire compartment to herself.”</p>
            
                <p>“Actually, Gryffindors are known for our boldness and loyalty, something I suppose, a self-seeking Slytherin would hardly understand...Wait, did you just liken me to Athena?</p>
            
                <p>“Right, snappish, little Goddess! Allegedly, Athena emerged from the forehead of Zeus. Makes a bloke wonder... Pray tell, little Goddess, did you pop right out from the chosen one? It would explain the scar.”</p>
            
                <p>He quirks a lazy, half-smirk, and listlessly taps his forehead, referencing Harry's scar. Rolling her eyes, Hermione decides to ignore him. He WILL leave soon enough. A shuffle down the corridor gains his attention, and he slides covertly into HER compartment and locks the door behind him.</p>
            
                <p>At this, Hermione's heart stammers, “What are you doing?”</p>
            
                <p>“Calm Athena. I have no wish to incite your wrath. I'm avoiding a particular individual, at the moment.” His tone is indifferent, but when a passing figure in the hall produces a shadow behind the fogged glass window, he immediately stiffens.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione snorts, “Oh, I see. You are hiding. You know, a little Gryffindor courage might do you some good.”</p>
            
                <p>“Semantics, you pedant. And why would I need courage when I am perfectly capable of the much superior trait, self-preservation.”</p>
            
                <p>In another time, far from the present, this may have caused Hermione to seethe and rage. She might have created a cacophony of indignant huffs and high-pitched gasps. But alas, 'twas the present. Her mind was very far, her cares were not one, and valor was dead.</p>
            
                <p>“Hm.”</p>
            
                <p>Nott curiously quirks his head to the side. Then, in a quite audacious move, he rises, strides to the bench across from her, and primly seats himself.</p>
            
                <p>Heaven's. Go Away.</p>
            
                <p>“'Hm?' That's all you afford to the depraved masses? What in Merlin's name did you do with Hermione Granger? I am owed a retort, I demand it! I've heard too much praise, too many alluring tales of hexes, dragons, and all the likes of crossing the formidable Hermione Granger.”</p>
            
                <p>With an eye roll, she huffs again, “Let them eat cake.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh my queen, you wound me!” The twinkle in his eye has become a flaming, massive, wicked thing. He grasps at his heart with faux adoration.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well, I'm glad you're versed in muggle politics. This conversation has been riveting, nevertheless, that's all the time I've laid aside for you. Now, I really must get back to reading my book.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh reading, yes, that is what I walked into.” Her eyes grow wide. His no longer twinkle, they are the blazing Sun.</p>
            
                <p>“Quite the sneak you are, Theodore. Wouldn't want others to think you're a creep, barging in on women like that. Some would question your propriety and all that nonsense you people fuss over.”</p>
            
                <p>He huffs a laugh, “Propriety, dear God, are you my governess? I haven't concerned myself with such drivel since my twelfth birthday when my father insisted that flogging one's offspring produces a 'good heir' and an 'indomitable character'. Never, have I ever, concerned myself with those prospects nor propriety, since.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is overcome with anguish. Nott Sr. was a death eater, yes. There were whispers of his cruelty, yes. Though, weren't all Death Eaters cruel? Yet, flogging his son? And at twelve years old for that matter? The Man was a sadist, on par with Bellatrix herself. To be the son of such a man? Oh, poor Theodore. Everything is so fucked up. Hermione doesn't respond, she doesn't know how.</p>
            
                <p>Thankfully, he breaks the silence, and waves his hand in a dramatic flourish, “Please, spare me your pity. I haven't concerned myself with that since twelve as well”, quirking another smile he continues, “What I would like to concern myself with is what you were doing when I came in.”</p>
            
                <p>Begone anguish for thee, irritation hath returneth to me.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well. Vitamins.” Her gaze meets anything other than his own. There is a chip on the wooden trunk rack above his head, it is shaped like a pear. Odd.</p>
            
                <p>“Vit-amins. Hm. And those are?”</p>
            
                <p>“Micronutrients and the like, necessary for proper body functions and all. Very helpful... Very-- muggle. Wouldn't do you any good to concern yourself...”</p>
            
                <p>Theo seems to ruminate on this. “Hmmm... Proper body functions... Should I be taking these things you call -- Vit-amins?”</p>
            
                <p>“No,no don't bother. I am sure all your meals are well stocked with the necessary nutrients. I partake in muggle habits, so you know…” She trails off. Demeaning muggle eating habits? What was she thinking?? Her brain is foggy, she is disoriented, and the medication is kicking in...AND THEODORE NOTT NEEDS TO GET OUT.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT. If she willed it, would it be enough to just, happen?</p>
            
                <p>She finally peeks a glance at Nott, noting something indiscernible in his eyes... Suspicion?</p>
            
                <p>“It's not me to pry... I take on the personal philosophy of 'live and let live' or ‘to each their own'.” Theo offers another wry smile, “However... I find it difficult to turn my attention away from people who share in the same pleasures as myself... So tell me, Goddess, most wise. What is in the vials?”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly, Hermione feels naked, exposed... Shit.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, we all dibble and dabble. We all do what we need to to get through.” He leans back in his seat and crosses an ankle over his knee. “It's only that I find joy in the art of discovering what exactly works for everyone. Call me voyeuristic of sorts.”</p>
            
                <p>“You are most definitely using that word wrong, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>“All the same, I'm interested in how you are coping, Hermione. And... If you ever need anything... Stronger, don't hesitate to ask.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione considers this, he very well could be of use. Perhaps. Until then, he will sit in her mind's corner of dusty, dark, and mysterious objects that may or may not- be useful. “Yes. Well, thank you for the gracious offer, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly the compartment door slides open again and Hermione silently curses the Pantheon of Greek Gods responsible. She reluctantly looks up to see who it is this time, and scowling his most infamous scowl, looms Draco Malfoy. Hermione immediately stiffens. His eyes are molten steel and there is not a single emotion betraying his cool exterior. Letting her gaze flit down his body she notices that he's grown. He's taller now. Where Nott is lanky and languid, Malfoy is all steel and stiff posture. Almost inhuman. Hermione shivers at the thought. With a fleeting nod to her, he turns and directs his full attention on Theo.</p>
            
                <p>“Theo, what the fuck? I've been scouring the whole bloody train looking for you. All five carriages.”</p>
            
                <p>Theo, ostensibly compliant with his capture, nods dramatically. “Yes, yes. Oh, Ancient Ruins, how will we ever get ahead if we don't read your family's entire private compendium on the matter, before leaving the sodding station.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally swoons. “Pri- Private compendium? On runes?” Her eyes are twinkling, she can't help. Someone help.</p>
            
                <p>Theo rises with an eye roll to rival the ages, “Great, Draco the trunks are already waterlogged as it is, no need to go about drenching their owners with your… Compendiums.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is a color. Hello world, I am Red. Draco's face betrays no emotion. Not even the twitch of a muscle. Is he stone? Hi, stone I'm Red. May I take a glance at your compendium? Just a peak? Damn pills. She was losing it.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT!</p>
            
                <p>“It was nice, not knowing you Nott. But, now I do. So erm- till next time, I suppose...” Or hopefully Nott. She wants to say it, but overkill.</p>
            
                <p>“It was lovely, little Goddess. Glad to see there's still some fire in there. Remember my offer." He offers a final parting smirk and wink, before striding past Malfoy and out of the compartment.</p>
            
                <p>Finally.</p>
            
                <p>However, Malfoy lingers. It's completely silent for a few moments, and Hermione's heart begins pounding in her chest. Is he going to hurt me? Kill me? She can't stop her incessant thoughts, so when he finally turns to face her she flinches. His steel-grey eyes meet hers, a palpable force that pins her to her seat.</p>
            
                <p>“Stay clear of Theo, Granger. He's my friend. Don't go ruining someone else's because you broke your own.”</p>
            
                <p>There's a swish of his robes, and the compartment door snaps shut.</p>
            
                <p>Prick.</p>
            
                <p>The sudden blow of long-awaited peace envelops her, she lies in a pool of numb tranquility.</p>
            
                <p>Bothered, who? Me? No, not ever again.</p>
            
                <p>I am color, I am rain, a Goddess whom from Zeus, I came.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione leans back, shifts her eyes closed, and allows herself to be claimed by a serene and dreamless sleep.</p>

            <h2> The Pheonix</h2>
            <div>
<p>The blaring of the train's whistle jolts Hermione from sleep. Spasms ricochet through her body on her ascent to consciousness, bringing about the slow return of sensation to her fingers and legs. Appendages accounted for, she goes about the painstaking task of prying her eyes open. A blur of mahogany comes into view and with it, the realization that her gaze is fixed heavenwards, to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Brain is mush, legs are lead, where is her neck? Slowly, oh so slowly, she begins to peel her spine from the upholstered bench. Finally, a creaky neck is accounted for among a mass of rickety bones. She reaches her hand to the back of her head and tentatively fingers the state of affairs. A ball of, something, is wedged behind her neck. And oh, God it's her hair. It's ..damp. Sigh.</p>

<p>Winding up all her strength and Gryffindor courage, she takes in her surroundings.</p>

<p>Blur, why is it so blurry?</p>

<p>Yellow.</p>

<p>Bright, blinding yellow, the most offending color she has ever seen, is across from her.</p>

<p>Hermione gathers all her brain power to muster a squint. Focus eyes. Focus. Two great, lime-green circular orbs swim into view. Then, a head. White hair-correction, albino blonde hair juts out from, Something…</p>

<p>Is that a cycling helmet?</p>

<p>There's only one logical answer to who exactly is sitting in front of her.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Luna.”</p>

<p>“Hi, Hermione”</p>

<p>“Luna? Erm- well, what are you wearing?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Luna glances down at herself. “My raincoat. Quite a pleasant color, wouldn't you agree?”</p>

<p>Luna's eyes are still coveted by orbs, nevertheless, Hermione still pictures them twinkling.</p>

<p>“No Luna. On your head, your eyes...”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Silly me, these are my Spectrespecs. I've redesigned them, you see.” With a dainty fist, she knocks the white surface of the helmet. Once, twice. Thrice. “Complete and total Wrackspurt protection.”</p>

<p>Hermione wills a small, pleasant nod.</p>

<p>“Your compartment is full of them. I think you've disturbed a colony. They seem to have taken a liking to your hair. I've been cataloging their movements whilst you slept. It's fascinating to analyze them in such a vulnerable state. They're usually quite guarded, but your hair seems to provide some sort of refuge.”</p>

<p>Merlin. Was that supposed to be a compliment? An involuntary curl pulls slightly on Hermione's upper lip. She allows it persist for only one, teensy moment, before she schools her features, and offers a small, strenuous smile.</p>

<p>“As always Luna, I've missed your insights.”</p>

<p>Luna seems unaffected and continues her observations.</p>

<p>To Hermione's relief, commotion from the hall brings about a means of escape.</p>

<p>“Yes, well... As always, I'm happy to be of use in any academic pursuit. Now, I think we should collect our things. It seems everyone is disembarking.”</p>

<p>In one swift motion, she moves to gather her outer robes, retrieves her beaded bag from the bench, and secures it tightly around her wrist.</p>

<p>A loud pop seizes her attention. Luna begins uncorking a bottle containing a suspicious, green substance and swiftly downs the contents, effectively wafting putrid smells into the small compartment. Luna looks to Hermione with a broad smile, her teeth are stained green. Green! Hermione is horrified to discover Luna nudging another unopened bottle into her hand.</p>

<p>“A gift. From father and I. We made five batches for my return to Hogwarts. I made one for everyone.”</p>

<p>With wary acquiescence, Hermione's fingers gingerly pinch the neck of the bottle, reluctantly taking it from the strange girl.</p>

<p>“My thanks to you and Xenophilius. Um, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Gurdyroot Elixir.”</p>

<p>Hermione wrangles a full-body squirm. She feels something escape, and her eye twitches.</p>

<p>“Tastes best warm, as tea, but you can drink it however you'd like. Helps to keep the Wrackspurts away. You'd do best to drink it at every meal, they seem to love your hair and bag..” She resumes her habit of trailing off again, turns, and slides out the compartment door.</p>

<p>Hermione peers at the bottle now in her possession. The stopper is crusty and slightly sticky. Unsure of how to approach this, she murmurs a quick reducio, shrinking the item to the size of her finger, and tucks it into a very far and seldom thought-of corner of her beaded bag. Without dwelling further on the matter, she follows after Luna.</p>

<p>Aside from herself and Luna, the train seems to be deserted. She breathes a sigh of relief. Hopefully, this means she won't have to encounter any familiar faces, and perhaps she'll even manage to slip off the train and make her way to the castle, completely unnoticed. The distant sounds of voices become apparent and she knows her hopes are dashed. Growing closer, discernible shouting fills the air. Two voices, female. One, high pitched and shrill. The other… authoritative, passionate, with a matter-of-fact tone…</p>

<p>Ginny.</p>

<p>With a rather rude shove past Luna, Hermione scrambles down the steps of the train to find Ginny and Tracie Davis standing less than a meter apart, both visibly seething.</p>

<p>Ginny is a portrait of fury, her eyes are alight with a fire completely harmonious with the scarlet of her waves. Her anger is palpable, filling the space around her and enveloping the air with her ruby essence. Her countenance seems to emanate, 'I am Genevra Weasley, do not dare tempt me.' The grip of her wand is fierce at her side, ready, but not aimed.</p>

<p>Davis, on the other hand, appears panicked. She gesticulates wildly, flinging her arms about in dramatic, frantic waves as if attempting to rally a mob to her cause. As if anyone would support her in her decision to go head-to-head with the formidable Ginevra Weasley.</p>

<p>Hermione steps forward, preparing herself. She must do something.</p>

<p>However, a hand appears on her shoulder and a broad chest blocks her approach. Looking up, she takes in Neville's concerned gaze. He's wearing those blasted worried eyes again, which Hermione thinks, is rather exasperating. With a gentle push of his palm, he guides her back to where Luna and Parvati now stand and offers an explanation, “Tracie accused Ginny of attempting to shove Pucey down the train steps.”</p>

<p>Parvati interjects with pointed enthusiasm, “Now she's defending her boyfriend's honor by challenging Ginny to a duel.”</p>

<p>Hermione does not school her features as her mouth falls agape, “That's unbelievable, Ginny would thrash her.”</p>

<p>Neville laughs knowingly, “Yeah well, Davis is willing to take the fall for her boyfriend. Pucey plays seeker, as does Ginny. There's only one team for the seventh and eighth years, inter-house unity and all..”</p>

<p>Yet again, Hermione is taken aback, “Inter-house unity?”</p>

<p>Parvati, giddy with gossip, interjects once more in a low, conspiratorial tone, “There are whispers of a single Quidditch team for returning seventh and eighth years. Not sure of the specifics, but everyone's going on about it. Each house is trying to find a way to ensure their players have a spot on the team. So..” Pavarti motions toward the girls still arguing, “If you're caught dueling you're sacked from the team. Davis is trying to rid Ginny of her chance at becoming Seeker.”</p>

<p>Well, that explains...</p>

<p>With a renewed sense of purpose, Hermione sidesteps Neville and strides confidently up to Davis, “Ahem, Davis. Since you've taken it upon yourself to defend your boyfriend's honor, I'd like to be Ginny's representative. Ready your wand, I haven't got all night."</p>

<p>Tracie steps backward, apprehension etching her features. She resumes her flailing gestures toward Ginny, "But... It's her! I called her to a duel!"</p>

<p>Hermione's eye roll is practically audible. Rain begins to pour, yet she stands her ground, obstinate.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all aware you're here on behalf of Pucey. Now, I've come on behalf of Ginny, so stop wringing her out, take up your wand, and focus on how you'll go about dueling me."</p>

<p>Draco stands motionless in the wet, squelching mud. His trousers and the hem of his robes are covered in thick grime. Rainwater trickles from the strands of his hair in delicate beads, tracing the gaunt lines of his cheekbones, pooling together to ricochet off his jaw in rivulets. He is transfixed by the cloudy-white eyes before him. With a huff, steam erupts from two bony nostrils, the force parting his hair back from his eyes.</p>

<p>Eyes, which, two years ago, could not perceive the creature in front of him.</p>

<p>Eyes, once faultless.</p>

<p>Eyes, now tarnished, from what he had witnessed, By what he had done.</p>

<p>A soft nudge at his arm derails him from his stupor. He finds Theo standing next to him. Wet, brown, mousy fringe is plastered about his forehead while he stares blankly at the creature before them both. “Everyone sees them now mate. Everyone.”</p>

<p>Draco swallows and nods.</p>

<p>“Come on now, time to join the others..”</p>

<p>With one last nudge, Theo strides toward the carriage doors and climbs in.</p>

<p>Looking back into the eyes of the Thestral, Draco breathes deeply. If he were to peer long enough into the eyes of the creature, he would have seen each death, every pair of eyes lost to darkness in his presence.</p>

<p>So instead, he swiftly turns on his heel and stalks toward the carriage.</p>

<p>Draco slips into the shelter of the carriage and produces a silent drying charm with his wand. He settles onto the bench and glances up to find Theo sporting his most ostentatious smile, "I would recommend a Scourgify too, mate. Your hem is abysmal."</p>

<p>Less than a minute in the carriage and Draco can already feel irritation prickling under his skin, "Washing is the only acceptable possibility; charms thin the thread. By now, I'd expect you to comprehend these concepts, Theo. Your grandfather practically wrote that damned pureblood handbook that forced the knowledge of 'proper garment care' onto me as 'necessary education' for all of us miserable heirs. Had to learn that rubbish at seven, the most excruciatingly dull lessons, and I blame you."</p>

<p>Theo raises a brow.</p>

<p>"Pah! Oh yes, thread preservation. At the top of my priority list. And for your information, I never had to learn 'proper garment care.' Father said, and I quote, 'That's what elves are for, you Nit,' when the governess tried to teach it to me. Anyway, I'd rather roll with the swine than continue with the inbred concepts cherished by a certain Cantankerous Nott."</p>

<p>Draco narrows his eyes, "Trust me, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments. But why do you continue to treat me like I'm some shifty Overlord? Are you to be a tosser all year?"</p>

<p>Theo's retort is a bitter murmur, "If you keep keeping tabs on me like some kind of lost puppy, I just might."</p>

<p>Blaise lets out a snort, “And I thought Pansy was bad.”</p>

<p>Both Draco and Theo's eyes drift toward the woman tucked into the far corner of the carriage her face pressed against the window, showing no sign of having overheard. With a lurch forward the carriage departs, and all four passengers carry on in silence.</p>

<p>The Great Hall appears resplendent as if no war had taken place within these same stone walls. Glittering candles descend from the charmed roof and illuminate the scene above, storm clouds and rain. Floating instruments carry forth mellifluous hymns as if attempting to fabricate a state of serenity. Four familiar banners rest above each table, beckoning students to their place of refuge.</p>

<p>She allows her gaze to flit across the room and eyes the stretch of stone where Remus, Tonks, and Fred once lay prone, lifeless. It is plain, devoid of the death that once imbued this place, and it just feels wrong. Pausing, in an attempt to gather herself, she squeezes her eyes shut.</p>

<p>Get it together Hermione. Just get through tonight.</p>

<p>She allows one moment to pass before she opens them again and banishes the distressing thoughts. In her state of renewed clarity, she takes note of an unfamiliar table situated at the far end of the hall. It is set perpendicular to the other four tables, seemingly plain and lacking decorum. Odd.</p>

<p>There is a sudden prod to her right rib. She looks about warily and finds Dean falling into step beside her. Wonderful.</p>

<p>“Can't believe you almost dueled Tracie Davis, Hermione. You are a right lioness.”</p>

<p>“Meow,” comes Seamus Finnegan now on her left flank.</p>

<p>Rolling her eyes for what seems like the umpteenth time, she realises belatedly this habit is going to persist ad nauseam.</p>

<p>She attempts ignorance and finds a place amongst the Gryffindor table. Ginny and Neville take positions on either side of her, enclosing her as if she is a flighty fledgling attempting to flee the nest.</p>

<p>Seamus and Dean settle opposite from them, and Seamus prattles on, “That Davis is a right pillock, shoulda done it, Hermione. Shoulda folded her body in two, stuffed her into a trunk, and sent her right back to the station.”</p>

<p>Ginny turns toward Hermione with a clear and intense expression, “We can't have you gallivanting the countryside going about defending my honour. I love you Hermione, and I would've been pleased to see Davis's head coming out her arse, but I'm really glad you didn't go after her.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small shrug, “I wasn't actually going to hex her.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know that. I'm just glad to have you on my side.”</p>

<p>Both girls exchange a small smile. Ginny discreetly clasps Hermione's hand under the table, giving it a tight squeeze.</p>

<p>A voice booms throughout the hall, ending their heart-to-heart, “STUDENTS! ATTENTION!”</p>

<p>All eyes lift toward the podium where Hagrid towers, seemingly surprised by his shocking cadence. He reddens and steps aside. McGonagall gives him a slight nod and approaches the podium.</p>

<p>She is draped in violet robes with a trail of morning glories adorning her hem. Keen eyes settled behind dainty spectacles scan the throng of students. Her eyes briefly land on Hermione's before flittering away. She lifts her chin and begins,</p>

<p>“I am gracious to be standing amongst you all tonight. We have been through many hardships in the course of the last few years. Many of you have faced trials that no witch or wizard, let alone children, should ever have had to endure. I do not say this lightly, I am most proud of my students here at Hogwarts. We will not ignore all that has happened; Our triumph over darkness was not without its many terrible losses. And for those, we mourn.”</p>

<p>McGonagall bows her head in respect for a few moments before proceeding,</p>

<p>“We have gathered here, in the castle that in many ways, sent each of you in directions imposed on you by your parents, your elders. Today we stand together once more. You, dear students, are the future of the Wizarding World. You now have a choice, a decision to shape it according to your vision. I am incredibly proud of every student who has chosen to join me and all our dedicated professors in returning to Hogwarts. This year will be marked by understanding, progress, and unity. Hereby, I would like to introduce a novel and transient house, a house whose namesake is inspired by our most noble headmasters: Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Both wizards were vital to the war's outcome, sacrificing their reputations and lives for righteousness. This house erected in their honour, will be comprised of seventh years and those returning for their eighth year. It will be known as the House of the Phoenix. From ashes, you will rise, and death shall not be proud, for you all have conquered.”</p>

<p>She gestures to the back of the hall, to the odd table placed perpendicular to the others. From above, a banner descends gracefully, its fabric rippling to unveil a flaming gold Phoenix set against a backdrop of deep violet. Atop the table, a runner appears adorned in the same violet hue, intricately embroidered with gold, it shimmers against the dark wooden surface.</p>

<p>McGonagall outstretches her arm toward the opulent display, “Students please welcome, the House of Phoenix.”</p>

<p>Stillness sweeps over the Great Hall like a seismic wave. Hermione is knocked from level ground and plunged into the abyss. Her ears are ringing amidst the piercing silence. What is happening? Amidst her disorientation, she vaguely hears Professor McGonagall continue,</p>

<p>“I would now ask that all seventh years and returning eighth years rise from their previous houses and conjoin at your new house table.”</p>

<p>Not one person stirs in response. Hermione is still plunging: down, down, down. The ringing in her head multiples. Instinctively her hand twitches toward her beaded bag.</p>

<p>Too much. This is too much. Why couldn't we have a normal year, for once?</p>

<p>The moment persists for an eternity. A “bloody ridiculous” emanates from somewhere, Hermione immediately thinks, Slytherin. At last, movement stirs to Hermione's right.</p>

<p>Neville rises, swings his leg over the bench, and strides purposefully toward the back table. Seconds pass, and then another figure emerges from Hufflepuff. Luna Lovegood breezes down the aisle toward the back table. Following her lead is Lavender Brown, her appearance notably disheveled compared to previous years and Parvati trails her from behind. Next, three from Ravenclaw: Cho Chang, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Padma. Michael Corner follows suit.</p>

<p>Across the table from her, Dean and Seamus exchange glances before shrugging and joining in the procession. Soon it is a flurry of movement as every seventh and eighth year convene at the back table. The only remaining Gryffindor's are Hermione and Ginny.</p>

<p>Hermione takes note that not one Slytherin has yet to make a move as well. A nudge to her side waylays her thoughts and she makes eye contact with the fiery redhead at her side,</p>

<p>“Come on Hermione, sod it.” And with that, Ginny rises and swaggers down the aisle.</p>

<p>Hermione glances toward the podium again and is met with those keen eyes and a highly arched, expecting brow.</p>

<p>Sod it. Sod it. Sod it ALL.</p>

<p>Swinging her leg over the bench she aims her gaze at an empty stretch of seating near the end. She avoids the many eyes set on her, approaches the table and awkwardly lowers herself onto the bench.</p>

<p>To everyone's surprise and enunciated by several audible gasps, Pansy Parkinson is the first to rise from Slytherin. Head down She rushes toward the Phoenix table. Blaise Zabini jumps up and strides after her. Then Slytherin after Slytherin rises, albeit begrudgingly, until the only remaining eighth years are Nott and Malfoy.</p>

<p>Finally, Theo raises his arms in an arching stretch and proceeds to climb from the Slytherin bench.</p>

<p>In the strain of the silence Malfoy drawls, “Et tu, Brute?”, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Theo turns to Malfoy and shrugs, “Slytherin has done shite for me.”</p>

<p>With that, he pads toward the Phoenix table.</p>

<p>Hermione currently finds her place setting quite riveting. She does not take notice of the two menacing brown eyes currently drilling holes in the back of her head.</p>

<p>Something within her squirms the moment she senses a familiar impetuous presence behind her. Turning, she finds Theo and his damned smirk. His tousled waves fall about his forehead and he shakes his head like a wet dog.</p>

<p>“Hello again, little Goddess. Mind if I take a seat next to my new favorite housemate?”</p>

<p>Hermione summons her most sardonic grin, preparing her quip, only to be spared from such glories by none other than Malfoy. Theodore is utterly unprepared to defend himself against the book that comes hurtling at his head, resulting in a loud thud upon contact with his ‘impeccable' hair. Malfoy, the truculent menace, (or saviour?) begins hauling him by the shoulder toward the other end of the table, where the other Slytherins now cluster together like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>McGonagall carries on, “Thank you all for your cooperation. Now, let us commence forth with the sorting of the first years!” With that McGonagall carries on with the usual Hogwarts welcome back customs."</p>

<p>Hermione, along with the rest of the Phoenix, seems disinterested in such frivolities. The entire table sits in silence throughout the sorting ceremony, the performance of the Hogwarts song, and the feast. Staring down at the untouched green pudding in front of her, Hermione is suddenly interrupted by a loud, throaty cough.</p>

<p>All heads swivel to the far end of the table, where she once sat in solitude. Following the many gazes with her own, she beholds a peculiar elderly man standing just to the right of her. He wears round, oversized spectacles, which make his green sparkling eyes appear two times larger than what is normally considered ‘proportionally pleasing'. His spectacles perch on a long, pointy nose just above a sparsely mustachioed lip, slightly shaven on the left, revealing a large, dull mole. He hunches over a cane, teetering dangerously to the side, his bald head reflecting light like a beacon, causing Hermione to wince, the glare piercing the back of her eyelids.</p>

<p>Despite his kind and bright eyes, there's a sense of mischief about him. He coughs his last, producing a hacking and painful sound, and speaks in a rickety voice, “House of Phoenix students, follow me to your dormitory.” With that, he turns swiftly and skips out of the hall.</p>

<p>Hermione exchanges a glance with Ginny down the table, receiving a gleam of excitement in return.</p>

<p>Everyone hurries after the old man, catching up to him on the staircase where he leans over his cane, heaving great gulping breaths. His pace now snail-like, inches him forward at an excruciating rate. After a few moments, like a toy with a new cell, he skips off again. This pattern is repeated intermittently. Hermione finds the whole ordeal reminiscent of one of her favorite childhood tales, Aesop's Fable, ‘The Tortoise and the Hare'. He is both Tortoise and Hare, simultaneously. Her mind drifts to Lord Dunsany's version of the tale, and she inwardly recites “a glorious victory for the forces of swiftness”, when he finally reaches the 7th floor.</p>

<p>The old man paces along the wall that previously housed the Room of Requirement, and to Hermione's dismay, appears to be attempting to conjure the door.</p>

<p>No. No. No.</p>

<p>Hermione is a deer, stunned, unmoving. Her mouth is parched. Her hands are clammy. Her voice cracks as she releases a mortifying shriek, “STOP!”</p>

<p>Turning slowly, the old man's eyes meet her own, questioningly.</p>

<p>She stutters, somewhat abashed at her nerve, “Um, you- you can't open it. It was destroyed… With fiendfyre.”</p>

<p>The only response and warning she receives is an impish wink. A door materializes behind him and he reaches for the shimmering handle, yanking it open. Hermione's heart stammers in her chest as she braces herself for the barrage of flames. However, to her surprise, none come. Instead, golden light drifts into the corridor, casting long shadows onto the walls behind the students, who stand peering at the open door, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>Hermione is shocked. How? How? How is this possible? She'd seen the flames herself. She felt the scorching ribbons brush her brow. She watched as Crabbe was swallowed whole by the inferno. How? She needs to know.</p>

<p>Another seems to be grappling with similar incredulity, “How?”</p>

<p>She turns, curious as to who produced the query, and finds Malfoy directly behind her, his jaw tight, eyes fixated on the door.</p>

<p>In response, the old man offers a toothy grin. “Fiendfyre: volatile, perilous, nearly impossible to be rid of. Yet, I know a secret” he pushes forward in a conspiratorial tone, “I've learned a strong Finite Incantatem does well enough in most cases.” Hermione's jaw falls off its hinge. There is no way...</p>

<p>Dismissing the unabashed gawking of the students, he carries on, “Without further ado, the Phoenix dormitories! Password is DoxyDung. I trust you will not go about chanting it in the corridors; might offend some rather prickly creatures.”</p>

<p>He gives another surreptitious wink and somehow his grin grows wider, “I am to be your head of house and strapping new, Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.” With this, he attempts a bow so low Hermione is afraid he might keel over.</p>

<p>“Professor NeatWanker at your service!”</p>

<p>Absolute silence. Everyone is afraid to dare breathe. To her right, Dean nudges Seamus with a whisper, “NeatWanker? Old geezer's setting himself up for a good ribbing.”</p>

<p>Seamus's left eye twitches, he looks tortured. His lips are pinched together, face reddening with the pass of each second.</p>

<p>Dean continues, “He's a literal wanker, Where'd they even find this codger? Went and Plucked him straight from the bloody tomb?”</p>

<p>Professor NeatWanker whirls his head towards Dean with exuberance, “Think I still got a few years left, wouldn't you say?” He demonstrates this by promptly breaking into a lively Irish step dance, using his cane to push himself off the ground at each arching leap.</p>

<p>Seamus the Tomato, erupts. His knee-slapping, elbow-jabbing, foot-trampling, and ear-splitting affairs claim several victims, including Hermione's foot.</p>

<p>Considering this most riveting performance and her freshly bruised toe, Hermione finds herself drained. She can't be bothered to handle any more unpredicted happenings for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Belatedly, the students file into the dormitory and find themselves welcomed by a large room lit by candlelight, with vast couches adorning the center of the room in front of a roaring hearth. Each side of the hearth is lined by two staircases, which Hermione surmises, lead to the boys' and girls' dormitories. Without hesitation, she presses onward, climbing the staircase situated to the right. Arriving at the top, she casts her gaze over the row of doors. A surge of relief floods through her when she spots her name shimmering, charmed to glitter in her presence, upon one of them. With a steady hand, she grasps the doorknob and pushes open the door to refuge.</p>

            <h2> Hence, These Tears</h2>
            <div>
<p>The reflection in the mirror has become far too familiar: hallowed cheeks, dull, lifeless eyes, and purple bags. Lips that pull slightly downward reveal a perpetual frown.</p>

<p>Impassive, soulless, a shell of his former self.</p>

<p>Draco observes himself through the one-way window of his mind. He assesses the image clinically, he should take better care of his appearance. He must convey composure, even if it feels futile. Anyone could be watching. He knows they lie in wait for the moment he falters, cracks. The moment he loses his shit or whatever it is they expect from him. He needs to stay vigilant.</p>

<p>He recalls Robards, practically salivating during the hearing, eager to drag him to Azkaban like he did his father. However, Draco was unyielding, he gave them nothing, not a twitch. When the allegations were presented, he stood there, chained to the floor like the disobedient dog they were itching to make of him. They wanted him to cower, to beg. He gave no contest to his culpability. Fixating his eyes on the Wizengamot and staring them down, he silently declared, ‘I don’t give a damn about what you do with me’. He was ready for his fate and had accepted it. That is, until Potter and Granger turned up, delivering their ludicrous testimonies, portraying him as some sad and helpless whelp, dubbing him a 'misguided youth' who had been under duress.</p>

<p>After days of interrogation and contentious debates, those two stalked into the courtroom, and like clockwork, he was acquitted the same day, albeit with just a year of academic probation. The defense, from two of the “Golden Trio”, made him look pathetic. Rita published that damn article, insinuating he’d paid them off. Fucking twat. Like he’d be so desperate.</p>

<p><i>Calm down.</i></p>

<p>He reminds himself that this is exactly why he has to stay behind the safe walls of his Occlumency. His father's shame. That scornful drawl echoes through his mind: “You’re too emotional, boy”, “You’ll always be soft” and “Your passions are disgraceful, restrain yourself, Draco”.</p>

<p>An eye in the mirror twitches.</p>

<p><i>Why does it always come back to him?</i></p>

<p><i>Stop.</i></p>

<p>He re-centers himself.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year. A chant, a Prayer.</i></p>

<p>After this, he’s leaving the continent. He’s taking everyone he has left: Mother and Theo. This is the goal, the only thing that’s keeping him from falling apart. His grip tightens on the edge of the sink and he leans down. His mind drifting towards her… Mother… Mother who is wasting away in the manor, biding her time in house arrest, staring out the large windows of the conservatory, surrounded by countless acres, utterly alone.</p>

<p>The walls crumble.</p>

<p>Draco eyes the reflection in the mirror, and the tears begin to cascade, streaking down his gaunt cheeks. His mind drifts away…</p>

<p>Tears, from a different time streaming, warm arms cradling him tightly, his head wedged in the crook of a neck…</p>

<p>Father had gone ‘on business”. It was always a vague, brief declaration, Draco pondered it a few times, Father didn’t have a job, had he? At any rate, he was Lord Lucius Malfoy, so Draco troubled himself no further.</p>

<p>It was spring, Mother approved his plea of having breakfast on the terrace in the east wing. He munched on bacon and observed the battle of winter and spring: Cold air wound up his legs, nipping at him ferociously, erupting goosebumps in its wake. Then, sunlight erupted like a warrior lying in wait, piercing the cold with his bronze grip. The war raged on… Draco chewed on, laughing and steeped in wonderment.</p>

<p>When father was away, he was permitted to wear whatever he so desired, and he always opted for play clothes. They made him feel free. He slid down the banisters in his loose shorts, snuck into the elves' chambers with dusty sleeves, rolled down the grassy hills with wild hair, and chased the peacocks in worn trainers. He was liberated, he could breathe.</p>

<p>Despite his mother’s coddling and leniency, he couldn’t help his diminishing behavior. He had his tantrums, became reckless, and sought out trouble. He couldn’t help it. The available air was overwhelming, it was exhilarating, it was sublime. Father would return, and it would end. Thinking of it made him anxious, so he grabbed at anything he could and held on for dear life.</p>

<p>After his bacon-exclusive meal, he climbed the manor walls, clinging to the lattice and vines. The leaves scratched at his bare arms as he lugged his broom up with him; The broom, his mother referred to as being, ‘twice his size’, but to Draco’s glee, father had insisted he have. He hadn't actually flown it yet, it was too big and hefty. It wouldn’t take off the ground, or at least not from the ground, he reasoned. Thus, he was standing on the roof, over the east tower, with the broom between his legs. He could see his untouched porridge on the terrace below, by now, likely cold and thickened. He peered into the distance, at the mist rising from the lake’s surface from the warm rays of sunlight. He wanted to brush against it, to twirl the mist in his fingertips.</p>

<p>He held onto that thought and leapt.</p>

<p>The spiral downward made his stomach swoop, the bacon was back in his throat. He jerked the broom, up, up, up. It complied for a moment before dipping again. The war between boy and broom, spring and winter, freedom and captivity, raged on as always. Finally, broom met tree and his grip slipped. He plunged through the branches which seemed to reach for him, only slightly slowing his descent. At last, his back hit the ground. His leg, dawned in his play shorts made a sharp snap. A cry reverberated through him. With a small pop, Dobby was there, gathering him and muttering something akin to, “Oh master Draco, Dobby is so sorry. Dobby will take you to Mistress.”</p>

<p>He was placed in warm arms. Tears streaked down his cheeks, wails and hiccuping came forth from his lips. Dobby healed his leg, Though, his cries still carried on.</p>

<p>Still cradled in soft arms, he was rocked soothingly, “Shh, my love. My sweet, daring child. You are so brave, so valiant.” She swayed with him for long, countless moments. Eventually, he ceased his cries and met her eyes.</p>

<p>“There he is. My perfect boy. I have you now. All is well.” In his mother’s arms, Draco could breathe. She rocked him until his head found its place in her neck, until his eyes fluttered close.</p>

<p>That night, father returned early, and with him, his reckoning. Play clothes were banished, broom met <i>incendio</i>, Dobby was beaten. And of Draco’s punishment, father never left again.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year.</i></p>

<p>Pounding at the bathroom door startles him to his senses. He straightens and stiffens. Tears cease, eyes tighten, and walls rise once more.</p>

<p>“On with it! Take the piss already! No use just staring at it! You’ve been in there for ages, Draco! Unless.. It’s not a piss you're taking... You know what, never mind, I’ll use the common room loo, you constipated Bowtruckle.”</p>

<p>Five in the morning and the prat is awake. Draco whirls, ripping open the door.</p>

<p>“Why, in Merlin’s name are you awake? I purposefully woke at five in the bloody morning as to avoid your ghastly voice.”</p>

<p>“Hush I know you're cranky, Draco but you know you love me, I’m irresistible.”</p>

<p>“Please, piss off. You're growing intolerable. I might just leave you behind when I’m through with this place.”</p>

<p>Draco pads to his bed to retrieve his satchel, heads toward the door and walks briskly out. As he heads down the stairs, Theo follows.</p>

<p>“You know you wouldn’t do that. Then I’d be all alone. I'd probably become some kind of mobster, making deals with vampires and that sort. I’m too much like my father when I’m lonely... Who is going to take care of me? I can’t bear to think of it. Growing old in that cold, dank manor, with spiderwebs in my sock drawer, sporting long fingernails and crusty lips. Eugh... If that ever is my fate, please just kill me.”</p>

<p>They reach the common room and pause. Sitting on a sofa in the far corner is Lavender Brown. She sports a high turtleneck and is staring out a

 window, seemingly unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>Theo whispers none too discreetly, “Shite, thought she was dead.”</p>

<p>He makes a gesture with his hand feigning slicing his throat, his eyes move to the back of his head and his tongue, slackened, spills out of his unhinged jaw.</p>

<p>Immediately, Brown whips her head around to face the two. Fortunately, Theo does seem to have a wit stashed deep under that thick head of his. He collects himself, turns back to Draco, and begins loudly proclaiming, “Bread, Draco! I need bread! Silly nutter, you. Itchy throat, remember? Does the trick. Ah, I’ve gotta go, to-erm.. take that piss I was telling you about... Yea, okay see you, bye…”</p>

<p>Loud thumping is followed as Theo dashes back up the stairs. Draco simply turns and continues toward the exit.</p>

<p>He thinks he’ll head to the library, just to study a bit, and prepare. Then, he’ll grab a quick breakfast from the Great Hall, he needs to pack some meat back on his bones and fill out the gauntness. Then, off to potions. It’s a good plan. Solid.</p>

<p>Hand on the door, he turns and eyes the back of Lavender Brown's head, she’s still sitting on the couch, facing the window. He looks through it too, the sun is new in the sky, and rays stream down onto the landscape below. The lake lies peacefully still and mist billows from its surface.</p>

<p>On second thought, maybe he’ll take a ride on his broom. After all, he's already donning his leisure wear under his robes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first day of classes and she’s late. Never has Hermione Jean Granger been late for anything. Taking two steps at a time, she rushes down the stairs to the dungeons for potions. A loud growl reverberates through her, causing her to momentarily teeter on a step. God, it’s her stomach. Disturbed, she points her wand at the responsible organ and mutters a <i>silencio</i>.</p>

<p>Having missed out on breakfast, she’s famished. And now she realizes she had scarcely eaten anything the evening before either. Frizzy hair whips into her eyes. She had no time to plait it. Her robes are wrinkled and askew, and she didn’t even have a moment to brush her teeth. She quickly whips out her wand in her descent and performs a quick <i>Scourgify</i> on her mouth. It stings slightly and leaves a residual feeling of uncleanliness, but at least her breath won’t reek.</p>

<p>How, how did she let this happen?</p>

<p>Memories of the previous evening are in shards and pieces. She remembers finding her room, claiming a bed, healing her foot, and pulling the canopy curtains closed. The rest is fuzzy.</p>

<p>Fragments rise: in her search for the balm, she discovered a vial of Draft of Peace at the bottom of her bag. Probably from her last medical run while camping with Harry and Ron. She needs to find a moment to clean it out. She’s still carrying that damned tent, too. She had taken the draught and then her medications. Shit she had taken both. She remembers floating in a pool of bliss, staring at the canopy ceiling. She was cocooned, safe.</p>

<p>Shit. She was high as a bloody kite.</p>

<p>Her mind is racing as she slips into class. Everyone is standing, lined around the room as Slughorn makes his announcements, thankfully he doesn't seem to notice her slipping in late.</p>

<p>“…Having said that, when you're seated please join your partner in prepping your ingredients for our first potion, sleeping draught.”</p>

<p>Hermione leans in towards Padma, whom she had squeezed in next to upon entering.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p>Padma eyes her suspiciously and then seems to think better of it, whispering, “Well, Slughorn has seating assignments for potions this year.”</p>

<p>“What? Why would he do that?"</p>

<p>“He said it was due to the inter-house unity initiative, McGonagall is taking it all very seriously.”</p>

<p>Padma’s name is called then and Slughorn has her take a seat next to Blaise Zabini. Slughorn continues.</p>

<p>“Pansy Parkinson, Neville Longbottom, right here next to the cabinets. Don’t let anyone go about taking anything without using the inventory system. Hogwarts does not have endless resources, students! However, if you or your families would like to donate to our potion stores, please see me after class. A wonderful opportunity for academic endorsement! Now where were we? Oh, yes! Luna Lovegood, Draco Malfoy here…”</p>

<p>He carries on and Hermione’s mind drifts towards the previous night again. Mixing Draft of Peace and her medications seemed to produce a heightened sense of euphoria, One she had never experienced before. Moonstone, Hellebore, Mandrake, Unicorn Horn, Porcupine quills. Combining muggle pharmaceuticals with potions is unexplored and highly volatile. This all needs to be evaluated later. Suddenly her name is called and she steps forward.</p>

<p>“And Theodore Nott, right across the aisle from Lovegood and Malfoy please.”</p>

<p>Hermione blanches. Oh, God. NO. She steps to her seat and sits discreetly. Maybe if she comes off as withdrawn or strange, he’ll leave her alone. Theodore sits in the chair beside her and turns his whole body toward her so that the full force of him is facing her. Hard Luck. She looks up and he’s smiling. It's the worst, most awful, unfortunately, warm and radiant smile.</p>

<p>“Who in the heavens did I so please? My new best friend, now housemate, AND assigned potions partner? Glorious, oh glorious!”</p>

<p>More like damned, damned, damned.</p>

<p>Hermione's gaze locks onto two piercing grey eyes across the aisle and over Theo's shoulder. Great, now she's on Malfoy's hit list. Move over Harry, Undesirable No. 1. is now Hermione Jean Granger. Setting up the Cauldron, Hermione groans to Theodore, “Why are you always so chipper?”</p>

<p>“What, would you rather I brood like dearest comrade Draco?”</p>

<p>They both peek at the sickly-looking man leaning over his cauldron across the aisle. He whips his piercing glare back at Hermione and appears to be attempting to <i>incendio</i> her hair. An <i>aguamenti</i> lingers on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>Hermione swallows, “ Erm-no, I suppose that would be... worse.”</p>

<p>Again, Theo shares his radiant smile, “That’s what I thought. You love me, for who I am. And I love you for you too.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice.” Not knowing how to respond to that, she hands him the Flobberworm mucus and he begins measuring out the quantity with precision.</p>

<p>“You know, I’ve been thinking... Since you’re no longer in Gryffindor, The title Gryffindor Princess doesn’t seem to be suitable. It doesn’t check the boxes, fill the bill, It’s a “lights are in but nobody’s home situation”.</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” Hermione drops the vial of wormwood essence but saves it from spilling.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“How you still have your arms and legs with that mouth of yours, is beyond me. It’s going to bring about your assassination.”</p>

<p>“Ooh, that implies anticipation and mystery, makes me seem relevant.” he winks, “Anyhow, what does that phrase mean, exactly? You see, I was bored out of my wits over the summer: abusive daddy imprisoned for life and all. I have that entire horrid manor all to myself. So I thought I’d take a stroll to my neighborhood muggle pub. You know, burying said hatchet and the like. I told myself, hey, be neighborly, Theo. The pub is about a three-kilometer stroll from the manor, had to charm my oxfords with cushioning charms! Anyway, a few hours later, I finally made it to the pub. I ran into a family of squirrels and.. well.. actually that’s a story for later, please do not derail me. Anyway, I made it to the pub and downed three ghastly pints of something called ‘spout’”</p>

<p>Hermione interrupts, “Stout?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! See, friends are quite convenient.” Another wink, “Now let me continue, I drink three of these dark and dubious substances and find I’m utterly sloshed! I go to pay and the Barman looks at me like I’m mad! Then I realized I was trying to pay with Galleons! Galleons at a Muggle pub, Hermione! Oh, silly me! When I handed him the coins, he turned to his workfellow and uttered that phrase, you know, '

The lights are on but nobody’s home.' I said, 'I do not dabble with electrons; I use candlelight. Or torches when I feel so inclined.' I attempted to explain that I didn't have pounders, but I would rush home, Floo to Gringotts, make the exchange, Floo back home, and then hurry back to the pub with his pounders in tow.”</p>

<p>Hermione, mouth agape in horror, hands the Valerian sprigs to Theo, listening intently whilst she absently grinds the asphodel petals.</p>

<p>“Oh don’t look at me like that Hermione, I was plastered! I was trying to fix it. Thought I’d give him the truth. He didn’t believe me anyway, He reached over the bar, grabbed me by the lapels, and began shaking me like the muggle coins would fall out of my pockets! This, this is when I knew I was, how you say, ‘with a pickle’”</p>

<p>“In, IN a pickle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, semantics, paramount information..." he rolls his eyes, "All things considered, I was able to scamper off unscathed! Only had to hand over my pocket watch and jacket, which I didn’t mind, as it was already a wrinkled mess. Oh and my shoes, now that was the worst of it, as I had to walk back those three kilometers, sloshed AND barefoot!”</p>

<p>Hermione erupted in laughter, “Oh my God Theo, you're an absolute pillock! How in Merlin’s name are you still alive? Breathing?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! This is what I’ve been trying to tell you! I’m a helpless, incompetent fellow. I need, need need, an intelligent, skilled, formidable goddess as a friend, at my side. Otherwise, I’m utterly hopeless.”</p>

<p>“You know… I suppose you aren’t so bad, Theodore Nott.”</p>

<p>He gleams, “I’m really Not.”</p>

<p>Professor Slughorn approaches their table, "Oh wonderful! Ms. Granger, Mr. Nott, Delightful work. What a pair these two!” Nevilles and Pansy’s cauldron begins boiling over and Slughorn rushes off.</p>

<p>Theo eyes her questioningly and Hermione gives a small nod. “Yes, Nott. Friends. We can be friends.”</p>

<p>“Great! I cannot wait for all the trouble we will get up to.” He gives her another playful wink and they continue on their tasks.</p>

<p>Hermione feels a kind of warmth from Theo. He has a depth about him, It’s something that he seems to want to hide from everyone. She knows this because she’s the same way. He’s suffered, this is certain. He’s alluded to his father too many times for it not to be some kind of wound. He is complex, a book with many of the pages stuck together. She doesn’t mind helping to peel some of them apart.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Ancient Runes, she finally finds herself a moment of peace. She allows her feet to lead her to a part of Hogwarts she knows she’ll be left alone. On the fourth floor, down a far and forgotten corridor lies a small courtyard. It boasts a tranquil fountain and several sculptures of headless baroque figures portraying dramatic, sensuous movements. She walks around one of these, trailing her fingers across the thigh of a man in supplication, to her bench. She rounds the statue and is abruptly aware of a figure already seated, writing in a journal, Malfoy.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry. I didn’t know you were here.”</p>

<p>He doesn’t lift his head from the journal, “Well now you know, off with you.”</p>

<p>What an absolute little prick. She stomps her foot down, refusing to entertain him. “Actually, you know what, you get out. This is my spot, I’ve been coming here since the fifth year.”</p>

<p>He still refuses to spare her a glance, “I thought that moldy corner in the back of the library was ‘your spot’. And no, I’ve been coming here since third.“</p>

<p>“It is not moldy!” He’s not wrong, it can be a little humid from time to time, but it’s the only part of the library no one ever roams. One of the few places she knows she won’t be disturbed.</p>

<p>Finally, he meets her eye. “It’s damp, Granger. All the books in the vicinity are waterlogged. It’s Probably why your hair is so frizzy and maybe even why that stick slid so far up your arse.” He gives a small, devious smirk.</p>

<p>What the fuck?? She strides toward him, hovering above him while he’s still seated. “Fuck you Malfoy. I punched you once and I will punch you again. No daddy to tell on either.”</p>

<p>He stands then and towers over her. She takes a step back, “What the fuck did you just say?” He steps forward, closing the distance between them again. When he speaks, his voice is low and authoritative, “The only reason I’m not rotting in Azkaban with him, as I should be, is because of you and that self-righteous hero complex of yours. Next time, keep that nose of yours in your soggy books and out of my business.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, they were going to put you in Azkaban. Harry and I... We couldn’t just let that happen. You’re no angel, obviously, but you were still just a child, dragged through it all.”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a child?” He stands above her and she swallows with trepidation.</p>

<p>“No. Not anymore, but- but you were. And you didn’t identify Harry at the manor. I don’t know why not, Malfoy. But you didn’t, nonetheless. Everyone needed to know that. The things they were saying about you before- well, you didn’t deserve it. I couldn’t keep that on my conscious, watching you get sent there, at least not without sharing the truth first.”</p>

<p>“I’m not some pity case, Granger. I did not ask anything of you. I would never. Just- just stop acting like your a fucking savior like Potter, stop fixing everything and everyone. You’re nothing without your awards and accolades. You’re just a-“</p>

<p>“A filthy mudblood.”</p>

<p>He winces, “That’s - that is not what I was going to say. Don’t put words in my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, those words have been in and out of your mouth from the moment you stepped on the train, all those years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yea, I’m shit, Granger, I know..” He’s still staring down at her, and she sees something in his eyes slip and falter. It's an imperceptible change, something you’d have to be staring at intently to notice, and she does. It’s then she realizes that the world is shit. Everyone is in so much pain, all suffering in their own ways.</p>

<p>“Just forget it, Malfoy. The spot is yours.” Finally, she breaks their gaze, turns, and walks away.</p>

<hr>

<p>She’s adrift, the tide pulls her, in and out. In and out.</p>

<p>She succumbs, no, embraces this.</p>

<p>The tide, the pull.</p>

<p>Leading her to open water, to the deep, blue abyss.</p>

<p>To comfort.</p>

<p>It is a river to the unknown. To being and un-being. She lets the unseen river guide her. She will not fight this, it is this feeling, the rich and sweet, which is real, absolute. The pull of it is viscous like honey, delightful and heady. She is beguiled, bewitched. The emptiness, the fullness, all at once. It is warm, like home…</p>

<p>Eyes open and dark coils are strewn across an extending arm. Fingers curl around an empty potion vial, sky blue capsules lie amongst white linens.</p>

<p>Eyes look toward the heavens to violet and gold drapes, spinning and swirling, round and round. she joins.</p>

<p>Round and round. A carousel. How Beautiful.</p>

<p>She remembers then…The small world spinning, everything was smaller then.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Mannequin horses bobbing, up and down. Laughter. A woman with bouncing curls, smiling up at a man with pure adoration in his gaze. A kiss to the temple.</p>

<p>Woman and Man.</p>

<p>Mother and Father.</p>

<p>Strangers.</p>

<p>Dead.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force rips her away, she’s whisked into oblivion, all alone.</p>

<p>Child.</p>

<p>Daughter.</p>

<p>Orphan.</p>

<p>Still adrift. Forgotten, left behind…</p>

<p>When will this make sense? When will it all just end? She had tried. Tried to do it all right. She sacrificed everything. So why did she deserve this? Was it all for not

?</p>

<p>It’s too much again, so she lets go, it’s easier to let it all go. The current claims her with its assuring arms, so she surrenders, it’s the only thing she can do.</p>

<p>Eyes close once more. Darkness comes to her again, a friend, her Casanova... She lies in wait for this forbidden lover and once again, renders herself whole when she feels its embrace.</p>

            <div>
                <p>“Welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts: NeatWanker style!” Professor NeatWanker's oversized eyes attempt a wink, but only produce a constrained squint.</p>

<p>“We commence the class here in the open air of the Quidditch Pitch!” Hermione watches as several students scan their surroundings with eager anticipation. “Now, now, steady on, young rascals! Today, we shan't indulge in the sport of Quidditch, but rather the exhilarating venture of gnome foraging!” Several groans are issued from the cluster of students.</p>

<p>“Gnomes may be harmless creatures, however, they do prove to have a nasty bite, given the opportunity! Be cautious, as today you will gather the gnomes, sans wand! Only your bare hands will suffice! You will place them here, in your burlap sack.” He brandishes a jute sack and the dimensions cover his entire frame.</p>

<p>“Feel free to partner up! The entirety of the Hogwarts grounds is at your disposal, however, after you've collected your spoils, kindly return to the Quidditch Pitch and we shall proceed with our lessons! Now, come one, come all! Don’t be shy, fetch a sack and a partner!”</p>

<p>Hermione surveys the crowd and her gaze lands on Malfoy, he is tugging at Theo, who is obviously struggling to break free. She continues her scan for a partner, and eyes Neville, who stands alone a few paces away.</p>

<p><i>Okay, no partner then.</i></p>

<p>Companionless, she joins the queue of students who wait for their sacks. Suddenly, there's a shove, and Theo’s gangly form is wedged in beside her. An “Oi!”, most likely from Seamus, emanates from behind. She turns, to offer an apology, and is met with Malfoy's glare over Seamus's shoulder. Neville, wearing a melancholic expression, stands a few paces further behind. Quickly, she returns her attention to the front.</p>

<p>Theo bumps her shoulder, “Hey, you. A delightful day, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Hermione shoots him a sidelong glance, “Hi Theodore, are you particularly skilled in gnome foraging?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t know, never seen one... Whole. Good ole’ daddy-O kept a pack of Jarvey’s around the grounds. He was particularly fond of observing their…trappings…”</p>

<p>“That’s awful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve found from personal experience that stumbling upon dismembered limbs while gathering sticks can be rather traumatising for a youngster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God. How old were you?”</p>

<p>“Six.”</p>

<p>Horrified and now positioned at the front of the queue, she retrieves a sack from the trunk and hands it to Theo.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we ought to make this a pleasant experience for you, partner.”</p>

<p>His grin is wide, “Please do.”</p>

<p>The pair venture off together and locate a thick hedge just outside the Quidditch Pitch. The sound of rustling from a large bush garners their attention. Hermione shoots Theo a look that communicates, “This one’s yours”.</p>

<p>Brimming with excitement, he plunges into the hedge with gusto. The hedge trembles and shakes violently, and the foliage ripples in his fervent rummaging. Loud snaps of twigs and the crunching of leaves ensue. Theo’s animated exclamations throughout the pursuit illustrate a vivid picture for Hermione's curiosity: there’s a “Gaah!” And a, “You little…!” followed by a “Got you, tiny demon!”. Eventually, he emerges on all fours, clutching a gnome tightly in one hand, a victorious grin is plastered on his face.</p>

<p>“Hurry, grab the sack! Take the miniature devil! Shit, it tried to bite me!!”</p>

<p>Hermione fumbles in her attempt to open the sack, whilst Theo continues to wrestle the hostile gnome. It’s especially plump around the waist and Hermione has to stretch the bag open widely for it to fit. On the way in, it’s teeth latch onto her arm and she releases a sharp cry. Theo jumps to his feet and pinches the gnome's belly in an attempt to loosen its grip.</p>

<p>“Fuck! Let go, you deranged vermin!”</p>

<p>Finally, he tugs on the gnome's goatee and it releases her, she falls to the ground and scoots away. Holding the gnome upside down by the leg, avoiding it’s gnashing and hissing, Theo shoves it into the sack, and quickly secures it shut. He gives it a fierce kick for good measure, then crouches down next to Hermione in the grass.</p>

<p>Taking her arm in hand he begins inspecting the open wound.</p>

<p>“Shit, are you okay Hermione?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yea…Do you— ah, fuck, do you know how to cast a healing charm?”</p>

<p>He nods, takes out his wand, and performs an Episkey. They both watch as the wound knits itself closed.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, that was my fault. I should have..” His look of concern is poignant and Hermione feels the compulsion to send it back to the abyss from whence it came, and to never,—ever endure that look from him again.</p>

<p>“No, no! Theo— it’s not your fault! I’m fine—It’s all healed, just a little sore.” Her smile is weak, yet she hopes it eases his concern.</p>

<p>He seems to relax, his shoulders droop and he brushes his mousy hair from his eyes. Running his hand across his face, he lets out a heavy exhale. A few moments of silence pass, until suddenly, he brightens and rummages through the pockets of his robes, retrieving a vial containing blue liquid.</p>

<p>“It’s a potion. I brewed it, it helps with pain and feeling... Well… better.”</p>

<p>Palming the vial, Hermione looks at him questioningly, his reply is a curt shrug and a devious smirk.</p>

<p>There he is.</p>

<p>Without further inquiry, she unstops the vial and downs the contents. The potion's journey down her throat produces a sting similar to liquor. Theo's smirk broadens into a grin. Once more, Theo digs through the pockets of his robes. He brandishes another vial of the same color, and swigs it. Exhausted, they both lie down amongst the vibrant grass. Then, Hermione’s world tilts. Colors begin to dance across the sky languidly, laughter bubbles out from her lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, Merlin Theo. This— This is good. What have you been keeping from me?”</p>

<p>He turns his head to face her. When their eyes meet, they both erupt in laughter. Finally, Theo calms, and waves his hands in a dramatic flourish, “Yes, I’m a genius. How about I show you mine, and you show me yours?” She nods enthusiastically and the chuckling resumes.</p>

<p>They lie there, in ecstasy, far past the end of D.A.D.A. They ignore the chime of the Dinner bells and the setting of the Sun. Finally, in the dark of night, Hermione’s bodily sensations return and she shivers from the crisp night air. Slowly, they peel themselves from the hard earth and walk haphazardly towards the castle. When they finally enter their house quarters, it is dark and silent. At the foot of the staircase to their separate dorms, Hermione reaches into her bag and pulls out her bottle of pills. She pours a few tablets into her hand and offers them to Theo.</p>

<p>“This helps with sleep… Among other things…Be careful.”</p>

<p>Outstretching her hand, Hermione drops a few pills into his palm. Theo stares down at them for a moment, nods, and pulls her into a tight embrace. At last, they depart their separate ways, each with bliss still thrumming through their veins.</p>

<hr>

<p>As dawn rises and peels back the curtain, Light performs her opening act. Time pauses with bated breath as Light executes an elegant arabesque and illuminates the skies, the world still paused, waits in anticipation. Finally, she hurtles across the Scottish Highlands in a magnificent Saut de Chat, the green hills erupt into the distance, and stretch on for eternity. The sky above, every blade of grass, and Draco release a shuddering exhale.</p>

<p>He shoots off, his chest flushed to the handle of his broom, as he races after her. She frolics and teases him as she prances across the ether in glittering rays. He dives, straightens, and whips across the countryside with calculated spirals — in his pursuit, dew and sweat amass on his neck and brow. Their dance is wild and controlled, peaceful and frenzied, both aware of this evanescent moment. When all darkness is finally exiled, light bounds heavenwards and finds her place with her master in the sky. Abandoned, Draco slows and collects himself with heaving breaths. For several moments, he looks on at the illuminated landscape, a soft breeze peels his damp hair off his forehead and to it, light places a gentle kiss. Finally, Draco pivots on his broom and departs.</p>

<p>Turning the handle to his room, the peace from his morning flight swiftly ceases when he is greeted by the sound of retching. In an instant, he is in the lavatory. Theo is leaning over the toilet, heaving.</p>

<p><i>Not again…</i></p>

<p>“Shit, Theo. Hold on.” Draco rushes to his trunk, yanks the lid open, and frantically rummages through it. His eyes finally catch sight of the red vial. He's only gone for a few moments, but when Draco returns, Theo now lies laterally across the tiles.</p>

<p>“Fuck.” Draco hoists him up into a sitting position against the wall.</p>

<p>“Theo! Open up, come on!” Theo’s head lulls to the side, eyes moving to the back of his head. “Fuck!”</p>

<p>With his fingers, he manually pries Theo’s mouth open, pours the contents in, and shuts it close. Theo begins coughing and spluttering, but Draco clasps his hand around his mouth to keep the contents in.</p>

<p>“Swallow Theo, come on! Fuck!” The spluttering continues for a few moments until finally Theo seems to take heed of Draco's request, and his throat visibly swallows. Finally, Draco unclasps his hand from Theo’s mouth and moves to the wall next to his friend.</p>

<p>Ragged inhales and shaky exhales fill the room.</p>

<hr>

<p>“Hey..”</p>

<p>Hermione looks up to find Neville standing above her, his usual woeful expression on full display. Ginny, an obviously reluctant spectator, lingers behind him. Hermione fights a full-body squirm.</p>

<p>“Hi. What’s this?”</p>

<p>Itching the back of his neck, he clears his throat.</p>

<p>”Erm, Just checking in, making sure you’re alright.”</p>

<p>Hermione shoves her irritation down, down.“Why wouldn’t it be?”</p>

<p>Neville’s distress noticeably intensifies, he releases a loud exhale through his nose. Belatedly, she realizes the response was not well received.</p>

<p>"Well, you've been rather withdrawn. You never join us for meals, always rushing about and consistently late for classes now. And it seems you're avoiding me for some reason..."</p>

<p>Her mind sounds the alarm: Run, flee, hide!</p>

<p>“No, Neville... I’m sorry... I’ve been really busy lately... Please don’t take it personally. It’s only that it’s been a hectic first week and all…”</p>

<p>His look of concern begins to dissipate, and he deflates slightly. "Yeah, I know this year has been tough for you. For everyone, really. Just please don’t—don’t shut us out, Hermione. We're a family, remember."</p>

<p><i>Family.</i></p>

<p>“Yea, yea, you’re right. No, sorry, I’ll be better Neville.” Hermione offers a small smile, albeit awkwardly.</p>

<p>He returns the smile broadly. "Great to hear it, Hermione. Well, I've got to go. I'm meeting Professor Sprout in the Forbidden Forest to forage for Bubotuber plants. Slughorn is running low on Bubotuber pus, so we've offered to collect some to replenish his stores.”</p>

<p>“Okay, Neville. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Neville beams, he pats Ginny on the back, gives her a pleased look, and departs toward the library exit. Ginny sinks into the chair across from Hermione and drops her head down onto the table, her mumbling into the mahogany wood is hardly audible, “Thanks for playing along.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small hum and eyes Ginny suspiciously. Sensing the glower directed her way, Ginny lifts her forehead from the table. A red blotch stretches from her hairline down to the top of her brow, she begins rubbing her eyes aggressively and lets out an exasperated groan.</p>

<p>“He’s been attempting to approach you all week. He's adamant that you've been avoiding him, which is obviously true… I tried to get him to just leave off, but you know Neville, he’s always fretting about one thing or another.”</p>

<p>Hermione rolls her eyes and returns her attention to her Arithmancy assignment, which is much, much, simpler.</p>

<p>“He tried to talk with me today, about Harry. All I could think about was how I wanted to slap that look off his face.”</p>

<p>Hermione drops her quill and grips her scalp, curls and all. “Aghh his eyes, Ginny! I can hardly bear to look at him anymore. That expression is always plastered on his face, you know the one—with the eyes, and the furrowed brow! I catch sight of it and all I want to do is throttle him!!” Her complaints rise in a passionate crescendo until a harsh “Shh” resonates from somewhere far away in the distance. Pince.</p>

<p>Ginny muffles a laugh into the crook of her arm, then recovers herself, “I know what you mean herms, just please, go easy on him, he’s been exceptionally sensitive lately… I think he feels some kind of responsibility for keeping everyone together.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.. You’re right I need to be more patient with him, he’s been through a lot…” She clears her throat, "So, did you talk to him…? About Harry?</p>

<p>“No. There’s not much to say, Hermione. He wants his space and I genuinely respect that decision, I've accepted it. There’s not anything else to divulge.”</p>

<p>Ginny starts picking at her fingers where a reddened patch lines the side of her thumb. She's especially rough in an exposed area, and blood begins to trickle down the side of her thumb. Hermione wants to reach across the table and assure her that everything is fine; Harry is just confused, he's so afraid, he’s lost everyone he’d ever loved. “He loves you, Gin.” Ginny looks up then and her eyes are glossy, “He’s just— afraid.”</p>

<p>Ginny merely nods in response and returns her gaze to her fingers. They sit in silence for a few minutes. Finally, Ginny lets out a shaky exhale and looks back to Hermione. "So, it's Friday. What are your plans for the weekend? Fancy a trip to Hogsmeade?"</p>

<p>Hermione looks back down at her parchment, “I can’t this weekend, I’m sorry. I— I have business…With the house and all…”</p>

<p>“I can go with you, you don’t have to do it all alone. You have friends, that’s what I’m for.”</p>

<p>“It's okay Gin, I need to do this alone. I want to do it alone.”</p>

<p><i>We all get through in our own ways, in our own time.</i></p>

<p>Ginny nods and doesn’t pry. Instead, she shares a hug with Hermione, reassures her that she’s here if she needs her, and moves to leave.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ginny?”</p>

<p>Ginny turns and cocks a brow.</p>

<p>“Is my spot,” Hermione gestures at the space around them, “Does this part of the library— does it seem moldy to you?”</p>

<p>Ginny gives an animated laugh and when she replies her back is turned and she’s already strolling away, “Most definitely.”</p>

<p>Hermione scowls down at the paper in front of her. Malfoy, the tosser. She ruminates on their encounter earlier in the week, he’s so fortunate not to be in Azkaban at the present moment, but he doesn’t have an ounce of gratitude. He sulks and blames her—Her! Thinking of the imbecile makes her want to rip her hair out.</p>

<p>Malfoy and his sulking…</p>

<p>Neville and his worrying…</p>

<p>Ginny… Ginny and the lesions on her fingers…</p>

<p>Theo and potions…</p>

<p>Harry and nightmares…</p>

<p>Ron and drinking…</p>

<p>Herself and…</p>

<p>…Hermione and her pills.</p>

<hr>

<p>“And the more I drink, the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink… I drink, so that I may suffer twice as much!”</p>

<p><i>-Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Standing on the pavement, Hermione takes a small, shuddering breath. The familiarity and the strangeness, all at once, is heartbreaking. The house, with its charming stonework and lattice vines, fills her with a comfort only a place called home could truly provide. Home. The sight of it, once a source of solace, now gouges a hole through her heart. She approaches. In the wind, leaves swirl about, some crunch underfoot while others nudge her trainers in welcome.</p>

<p>She keys the lock and when the door swings open, the stale air hits her. Entering slowly, she scans the sitting room. The sofa and table, covered with dust, remain in their usual spots. Everything is in its place, and it feels so wrong. What was once a vibrant home, is now just an empty house. She pauses in front of a framed photo. Mom. Her Mother’s eyes shine with warmth and one of her arms rests around empty air. Dad is smiling down at the space where her mother’s arm rests.</p>

<p><i>Orphan.</i></p>

<p>Hermione is stone. Moments, minutes, hours, days, years, eons pass. She was forged in the beginning of time, birthed in the abyss, unearthed by jagged hands. She was formed by those same hands: molded, refined, sculpted. She was praised, glorified. The Storms and war weathered her. She deteriorated, decayed, and disintegrated to dust. Now she lives in the wind, never to be whole again.</p>

<p>Hermione leaves.</p>

<p>She gathers the post that has accumulated on the entrance floor and steps back out the door. With a final click of the lock, she turns and makes her way back down the brick path... A figure standing beyond the Pickett fence startles her. He’s a lanky man, young looking, Hermione surmises, with jet black hair that falls heavily over his coal-lined eyes. He sports a leather jacket and is adorned with several pieces of jewelry: studded bracelets with spikes cover his wrists, hooped silver earrings line the side of his earlobes, and a chunky silver chain rests over his chest.</p>

<p>Hermione’s hand moves toward the wand in her back pocket, “Um, Hello… How can I help you?”</p>

<p>“Hermione?” The voice is familiar, but Hermione can’t place it.</p>

<p>“How do you know my name?” She’s fighting the panic that is pounding in her ears telling her to RUN, RUN, RUN.</p>

<p>He seems to sense her anxiety and reaches his arms out placatingly, “Hey, Hermione. Cool down, it’s just me, Jacob!” He pushes his hair from his forehead and Hermione immediately recognizes her childhood friend. “Oh my God! Jacob! Your hair! And what happened to your glasses?”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately runs over and pulls the boy she hasn’t seen in ages into a tight hug. He returns the hug and when they pull apart they both examine each other. When they speak, it's simultaneously.</p>

<p>“How are you??” “How have you been?”</p>

<p>They both laugh and Jacob advances in his query “I haven’t seen you in ages! Where have you been? How are you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been… At school, in, erm— France.”</p>

<p>He looks at her, flabbergasted, “Wow Hermione, I knew you were bright back in the day but an international student, that’s— that’s great. It seems like France has treated you well…”</p>

<p>He grabs a curl, stretches it and when he lets go, there’s an amused twinkle in his eye while he watches it spring back into place. Hermione swats at him playfully and looks up at his dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>“How are you, Jacob? You must have graduated, what, two years ago now? Do you still live down the street?”</p>

<p>Still smiling and peering at her with awe, he shakes his head, “No, I moved out a few years ago. Just visiting and doing some business in the neighborhood. I actually live in the Old Smoke. I run a small, humble— nightclub.”</p>

<p>His grin morphs into a smirk. The incessant smiling and his flirtatious behavior confounds her, she blushes profusely.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow! That’s pretty wicked, Jacob.”</p>

<p>He seems pleased by the praise and reaches into his back pocket, he pulls out his wallet and rifles through the cardholders. Hermione eyes a tiny plastic bag filled with white shiny powder wedged between a thick wad of banknotes. She swiftly deflects her gaze.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he hands her a card with the name <i>The Velvet Flame.</i></p>

<p>“In case you ever find yourself in the city, looking for a familiar face. I live upstairs, just let the bouncer know you're looking to ‘climb Jacob’s ladder’.” Hermione stares down at the card, her face is set aflame. She gives him a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>“Real smooth Jacob, however, I will not be climbing any of your ladders.”</p>

<p>“Oh calm, Hermione. It's just a way I distinguish my true friends from those who pretend to be, just to skip the line. It's not meant to be taken literally, it’s used commonly enough by my closest of friends.” With a final wink, he begins to back away.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’ve got to run, it's almost six, and I have some last-minute preparations to see to before we open for the night. Maybe I'll see you soon?”</p>

<p>He continues backing away and she responds with a small nod. She mumbles, mostly to herself, “Yeah, Jacob, you just might.”</p>
