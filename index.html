            <p>Everything is in ruin.
                Everyone is in ruin.
                Hermione Granger must return to Hogwarts for her final year. She only needs to get through. They all do. However, returning to how things were, isn't an option. She will lose no more of her time, she'll do what she likes. She deserves it, doesn't she?
                Draco Malfoy wants to run away. He's returning to Hogwarts with his last mission, to fulfill the Ministry's required probation and then he's off the map. He's going to vanish. It's his only option. But he won't leave alone, he's going to drag along his best friend. Finish the year, and they'll finally be free, right?
                Theodore Nott, thinks not. You see he's made a new friend. And they have plans, to live it up and be teenagers, while they still can.

            <h2> To The Gallows</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Fog… fog everywhere… fog obscuring her vision, dampening her lungs, gathering on the fine hairs of her neck and cheek. Fog assaulting her senses, distorting the hustle and bustle that surrounds her, and leaving the taste of salt and soot on her tongue.</p>

                <p>Birthed by the Atlantic, ferried by the Thames, fog shrouds the scene of Platform 9 ¾ like a somber veil.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione Granger finds herself suddenly struck with an affection for Charles Dickens; never before has she had any particular affinity for the lengthy prose detailing the dreary, oppressive fog as done so in <i>Bleak House</i>. Though now, for the first time, she fully comprehends its significance.</p>
            
                <p>The fog— thick and stagnant— looms eerily over the platform with a suffocating presence. Yet, this does little to hinder the bustling crowd; the platform is busier than ever. Families rush past, mothers chasing after their children with final attempts at nagging their young. Packs of students, donned in black robes scurry past, caught up in enthusiastic susurrations. Boys and girls lean out from the train windows shouting over the din, while parents look on- tears welling in their eyes.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione appears to be the only one taken captive by the thick fog which encapsulates the platform and the rain-soaked muck and grime which litters the stone. Though she intends to step forward, apprehension sets in, halting her. She could blame it on the onslaught to her senses—the overwhelming amalgamation of fog and commotion— that sends her into a state of paralysis. But in reality, it is the anxiety creeping up her spine and the ominous foreboding that such fog denotes.</p>
            
                <p>In her momentarily lapse of cognizance, she is shoved from behind.</p>
            
                <p>“Ger out the way!” Someone, somewhere yells. She thinks...</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is not quite sure and couldn't be bothered to care. The pounding in her head is making everything hazy and muddled. It's all too overwhelming. She begins to question whether her decision to return is a sensible one.</p>
            
                <p>She reminds herself: Deep breaths. One. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>In an attempt to calm her thoughts, she draws her attention to the skies, wherein she witnesses a most repugnant union: billows of heavy smoke loft from the smokestack of the train, mixing, fusing, and coagulating with droplets of rain, until all that meets earth is damp, mildewed soot.</p>
            
                <p>Definitely not helping.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's diverts her gaze, this time more frantically, searching for any distraction from the anxiety creeping its way under her skin.</p>
            
                <p>She focuses ahead, on a bundle of wet trunks stacked the height of three men. It leans precariously to the right, looming toward the ground like a melancholic Tower of Pisa. Directly beneath this impending doom, stands an old hag, who reaches up, and pinches the cheeks of a grown man. The hag is bent so far backward that it appears her spine may just snap in half. Hermione narrows her attention to the unfortunate man in her company.</p>
            
                <p>Neville?</p>
            
                <p>Hermione's unintended perusing catches his attention. His gaze snaps up, and his expression of raw concern sends her anxiety rocketing to new heights. Neville has always possessed an unusually abundant amount of nurturing instincts, tending to his friends as he does his plants. However, since the end of the war, his caring disposition has only seemed to intensify, making him insufferable company.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally rejoices at the fact that he is not close enough to witness her panic, and satisfies the situation by acknowledging him with a slight tip to her chin.</p>
            
                <p>Yes, Neville. All is well.</p>
            
                <p>Oblivious to her internal struggle, Neville offers a half-smile in return. However, his grandmother— the hag— seems to take notice of the gesture and twirls to face Hermione with unnatural speed. Her crimson spectacles slide a fraction lower on her nose as she unleashes a glare rivaling that of the entire ancestry of the Sacred 28. Duly noted. Perhaps Neville's Grandmother should be dispatched upon the arrival of the next dark lord, the glare alone would do.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione returns her attention to the train.</p>
            
                <p>One Breath. Two. Three.</p>
            
                <p>Without any warning, she suddenly breaks into panic. Fumbling for her beaded bag, she urgently pries it open.</p>
            
                <p>Where are they? Did she pack them? How did she forget? She has to go back. Just to check.</p>
            
                <p>In her mania, a gentle hand reaches out to grasp her arm, “Hermione.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry? What is it? I forgot something... Oh, bother. I need to go back, I forgot. I need-”</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, look at me,” he demands.</p>
            
                <p>His voice is calm and focused, but her hand does not relent its frantic rummaging through her bag. Suddenly, her fingers catch on a pouch and she sifts her fingers through the contents within.</p>
            
                <p>One. Two bottles. Yes, they're here.</p>
            
                <p>Her sigh of relief is palpable.</p>
            
                <p>“I knew you had what you were looking for. Take a breather, alright?”</p>
            
                <p>Finally, she looks up at Harry. His brows are furrowed, his gaze darting from her bag and then back to her face.</p>
            
                <p>Does he know?</p>
            
                <p>She banishes the thought, there is really nothing he can do. He's done enough. She allows her attention to zero in on what he can control, his soiled spectacles.</p>
            
                <p>Some things will never change.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione reaches up, removes them from his face, and taking the hem of her blouse between her fingertips, polishes them gently.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. You're right. It'll all be alright. I have everything I need, thank you.” She tries to put strength in her words, but they still sound weak.</p>
            
                <p>“I'm an owl away Hermione, don't forget it. You'll have Ginny, too. Ron and I wish you would stay, but I know the N.E.W.T.S., they're- erm, well I know how important they are to you. Ron and I will be here if you need anything... Please, just don't be a stranger, send an owl once in a while.”</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, Harry. Thanks, I will.” She offers a placating smile.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione wants to go on and say he should come too, that he needs to face it alongside her. He needs to find some kind of closure, Auror training will be there when they return. She wants to voice that Ron should be here too; that he should be with his friends, and needs something other than Firewhisky to help him cope.</p>
            
                <p>She wants to say that she's only going because she needs this. Maybe everything: all her anxiety, panic attacks, her addiction will end if she just faces the place where it all began. Her heart is aching to voice that if they can do this together like they always do, maybe everything will just be alright. They have a better chance together, they always have.</p>
            
                <p>Though, she doesn't say any of it. Instead, she places a small kiss to his cheek, pulls him into a hug, and makes her way toward the sound of the blowing whistle.</p>
            
                <p>Onwards, solider.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione peers over her shoulder one last time and notices Harry shifting on his feet nervously. His gaze is fixed on an empty bench, just to the right.</p>
            
                <p>“Harry... Go find Gin. Just-- don't leave without a goodbye. She doesn't deserve that...”</p>
            
                <p>Harry nods and his eyes look a bit clearer when he steps back from the train. Another nod, and he widens the distance between them. The motion marks the first moment the chasm divides them. Her heart aches in her chest. They stare at each other for another moment, until finally, Harry swiftly turns on his heels and rushes off to find Ginny. Hermione watches him depart, then, tucking a stray hair behind her ear, turns to face the carriage.</p>
            
                <p>Billowing smoke, soggy soot. Fog.</p>
            
                <p>Deep breaths. One, Two.</p>
            
                <p>One little step, another makes two. And up she goes, toward doom's impending beak.</p>
            
                <p>“So gently you came rapping,</p>
            
                <blockquote>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door”</blockquote>
            
                <p>The Raven, Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
            
                <p>On the train, the bustling sounds associated with imminent departure envelope the air. Trunks thud against panels, raucous hollering, and shrill laughter emanate from every direction as owls and familiars hoot and squeal over the din.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! A door shuts a few meters ahead.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! Two first-years giggle while tussling with a compartment door; opening and closing it repeatedly.</p>
            
                <p>It's too much.</p>
            
                <p>Further along the corridor, a playful quarrel erupts. A young boy wedges himself between a door, laughing uncontrollably, while a girl inside the compartment emits a playful shriek, trying to keep him out. The boy, donned in dress shoes, struggles to find traction on the wooden floor. He slips and slides on the polished wood, accidentally banging his foot against the wall panel- over and over again.</p>
            
                <p>Bang! More hollering. Screeching. Laughing.</p>
            
                <p>“Let me in Peggie!”</p>
            
                <p>Snickering. And cackling.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>“Little mud-blood”.</p>
            
                <p>Bang!</p>
            
                <p>In her haze, she scrambles for her wand, about to cast a hasty <i>Petrificus Totalus</i>, when jet-black hair catches the corner of her eye.</p>
            
                <p>No. It can't be.</p>
            
                <p>Then suddenly, two familiar eyes meet her own, for the second time that day. Neville. She's already aware he can see the mania plastered across her face, and there's no way she can hide it. With no other option, she turns on her heel and flees down the corridor in the opposite direction. In her haste, she accidentally runs into a young boy.</p>
            
                <p>“Sorry.” Their gazes lock briefly, she can tell the moment that it all clicks in his head, when he realizes he's just collided with the Hermione Granger. The reaction is always the same – eyes wide, mouth agape— it's maddening.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione!” Neville's voice cuts through the chaos. “Hermione, come back!”</p>
            
                <p>Without a second thought, she pushes past the boy and scrambles into the next train carriage. She doesn't look back once as she crosses the corridor into the third and then the fourth carriage. Finally, the overwhelming sounds begin to fade and discreetly slips into an empty compartment. Collapsing onto the bench, she lets out a heavy breath, and her hands reach up to cup her face. She inhales deeply. It's on the exhale when everything within her shatters. The sobs emerge. They convulse through her body, jerking her shoulder in erratic spasms. Her hands tremble as she holds her face, trying to suppress the wails she has no control over. Hermione slumps further into her hands. Three more sobs are all she allows.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>Gradually she lifts her chin and focuses on her measured, deep breaths.</p>
            
                <p>One, two, three.</p>
            
                <p>One last heavy sigh and she regains control of herself. She wipes her eyes, and nose, and collects the remnants of her tears with her sleeves. She heaves another glorious breath.</p>
            
                <p>Come off it, Hermione. You won a war for Goodrick's sake.</p>
            
                <p>There is a blaring of the whistle and a sudden jerk of the train as it shifts into motion. Hermione reaches into her beaded bag and locates the pouch she so treasures. Unfastening the clasp, she eyes the two vials: amitriptyline a muggle antidepressant, and diazepam. She has already taken her morning dose of both, but she needs another.</p>
            
                <p>It's just all too much.</p>
            
                <p>She discreetly slips a pill into her palm and gathers enough saliva for a swallow. Just as she raises her hand to her mouth and tilts her head back to swallow the pill, the compartment door jerks open. In a swift movement, she swallows sharply, forcing the pill down. Down. Hastily, she fumbles the lid back onto the vial and stows the evidence back into her beaded bag. Hermione stares at the ground for a few moments, until finally she tucks her hair behind her ear and raises her eyes to the intruder.</p>
            
                <p>“Well Hello, Granger”</p>
            
                <p>“Nott”</p>
            
                <p>Theodore Nott's lanky figure is angled languidly against the doorframe. His robes are pristine, tailored perfectly to his form. His hair coils around his face, framing it with a messy, tousled look. Full lips quirk menacingly as he gazes at her with a sardonic twinkle in his brown eyes.</p>
            
                <p>“My, my Granger. What do we have here?”</p>
            
                <p>“Carry on, Nott this compartment is full.” His eyes glint with mischief.</p>
            
                <p>“And I thought Gryffindor's were supposed to be selfless... Although, I suppose Athena has paid the price for an entire compartment to herself.”</p>
            
                <p>“Actually, Gryffindors are known for our boldness and loyalty, something I suppose, a self-seeking Slytherin would hardly understand...Wait, did you just liken me to Athena?</p>
            
                <p>“Right, snappish, little Goddess! Allegedly, Athena emerged from the forehead of Zeus. Makes a bloke wonder... Pray tell, little Goddess, did you pop right out from the chosen one? It would explain the scar.”</p>
            
                <p>He quirks a lazy, half-smirk, and listlessly taps his forehead, referencing Harry's scar. Rolling her eyes, Hermione decides to ignore him. He WILL leave soon enough. A shuffle down the corridor gains his attention, and he slides covertly into HER compartment and locks the door behind him.</p>
            
                <p>At this, Hermione's heart stammers, “What are you doing?”</p>
            
                <p>“Calm Athena. I have no wish to incite your wrath. I'm avoiding a particular individual, at the moment.” His tone is indifferent, but when a passing figure in the hall produces a shadow behind the fogged glass window, he immediately stiffens.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione snorts, “Oh, I see. You are hiding. You know, a little Gryffindor courage might do you some good.”</p>
            
                <p>“Semantics, you pedant. And why would I need courage when I am perfectly capable of the much superior trait, self-preservation.”</p>
            
                <p>In another time, far from the present, this may have caused Hermione to seethe and rage. She might have created a cacophony of indignant huffs and high-pitched gasps. But alas, 'twas the present. Her mind was very far, her cares were not one, and valor was dead.</p>
            
                <p>“Hm.”</p>
            
                <p>Nott curiously quirks his head to the side. Then, in a quite audacious move, he rises, strides to the bench across from her, and primly seats himself.</p>
            
                <p>Heaven's. Go Away.</p>
            
                <p>“'Hm?' That's all you afford to the depraved masses? What in Merlin's name did you do with Hermione Granger? I am owed a retort, I demand it! I've heard too much praise, too many alluring tales of hexes, dragons, and all the likes of crossing the formidable Hermione Granger.”</p>
            
                <p>With an eye roll, she huffs again, “Let them eat cake.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh my queen, you wound me!” The twinkle in his eye has become a flaming, massive, wicked thing. He grasps at his heart with faux adoration.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well, I'm glad you're versed in muggle politics. This conversation has been riveting, nevertheless, that's all the time I've laid aside for you. Now, I really must get back to reading my book.”</p>
            
                <p>“Oh reading, yes, that is what I walked into.” Her eyes grow wide. His no longer twinkle, they are the blazing Sun.</p>
            
                <p>“Quite the sneak you are, Theodore. Wouldn't want others to think you're a creep, barging in on women like that. Some would question your propriety and all that nonsense you people fuss over.”</p>
            
                <p>He huffs a laugh, “Propriety, dear God, are you my governess? I haven't concerned myself with such drivel since my twelfth birthday when my father insisted that flogging one's offspring produces a 'good heir' and an 'indomitable character'. Never, have I ever, concerned myself with those prospects nor propriety, since.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is overcome with anguish. Nott Sr. was a death eater, yes. There were whispers of his cruelty, yes. Though, weren't all Death Eaters cruel? Yet, flogging his son? And at twelve years old for that matter? The Man was a sadist, on par with Bellatrix herself. To be the son of such a man? Oh, poor Theodore. Everything is so fucked up. Hermione doesn't respond, she doesn't know how.</p>
            
                <p>Thankfully, he breaks the silence, and waves his hand in a dramatic flourish, “Please, spare me your pity. I haven't concerned myself with that since twelve as well”, quirking another smile he continues, “What I would like to concern myself with is what you were doing when I came in.”</p>
            
                <p>Begone anguish for thee, irritation hath returneth to me.</p>
            
                <p>“Yes, well. Vitamins.” Her gaze meets anything other than his own. There is a chip on the wooden trunk rack above his head, it is shaped like a pear. Odd.</p>
            
                <p>“Vit-amins. Hm. And those are?”</p>
            
                <p>“Micronutrients and the like, necessary for proper body functions and all. Very helpful... Very-- muggle. Wouldn't do you any good to concern yourself...”</p>
            
                <p>Theo seems to ruminate on this. “Hmmm... Proper body functions... Should I be taking these things you call -- Vit-amins?”</p>
            
                <p>“No,no don't bother. I am sure all your meals are well stocked with the necessary nutrients. I partake in muggle habits, so you know…” She trails off. Demeaning muggle eating habits? What was she thinking?? Her brain is foggy, she is disoriented, and the medication is kicking in...AND THEODORE NOTT NEEDS TO GET OUT.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT. If she willed it, would it be enough to just, happen?</p>
            
                <p>She finally peeks a glance at Nott, noting something indiscernible in his eyes... Suspicion?</p>
            
                <p>“It's not me to pry... I take on the personal philosophy of 'live and let live' or 'to each their own'.” Theo offers another wry smile, “However... I find it difficult to turn my attention away from people who share in the same pleasures as myself... So tell me, Goddess, most wise. What is in the vials?”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly, Hermione feels naked, exposed... Shit.</p>
            
                <p>“Hermione, we all dibble and dabble. We all do what we need to to get through.” He leans back in his seat and crosses an ankle over his knee. “It's only that I find joy in the art of discovering what exactly works for everyone. Call me voyeuristic of sorts.”</p>
            
                <p>“You are most definitely using that word wrong, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>“All the same, I'm interested in how you are coping, Hermione. And... If you ever need anything... Stronger, don't hesitate to ask.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione considers this, he very well could be of use. Perhaps. Until then, he will sit in her mind's corner of dusty, dark, and mysterious objects that may or may not- be useful. “Yes. Well, thank you for the gracious offer, Nott.”</p>
            
                <p>Suddenly the compartment door slides open again and Hermione silently curses the Pantheon of Greek Gods responsible. She reluctantly looks up to see who it is this time, and scowling his most infamous scowl, looms Draco Malfoy. Hermione immediately stiffens. His eyes are molten steel and there is not a single emotion betraying his cool exterior. Letting her gaze flit down his body she notices that he's grown. He's taller now. Where Nott is lanky and languid, Malfoy is all steel and stiff posture. Almost inhuman. Hermione shivers at the thought. With a fleeting nod to her, he turns and directs his full attention on Theo.</p>
            
                <p>“Theo, what the fuck? I've been scouring the whole bloody train looking for you. All five carriages.”</p>
            
                <p>Theo, ostensibly compliant with his capture, nods dramatically. “Yes, yes. Oh, Ancient Ruins, how will we ever get ahead if we don't read your family's entire private compendium on the matter, before leaving the sodding station.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione internally swoons. “Pri- Private compendium? On runes?” Her eyes are twinkling, she can't help. Someone help.</p>
            
                <p>Theo rises with an eye roll to rival the ages, “Great, Draco the trunks are already waterlogged as it is, no need to go about drenching their owners with your… Compendiums.”</p>
            
                <p>Hermione is a color. Hello world, I am Red. Draco's face betrays no emotion. Not even the twitch of a muscle. Is he stone? Hi, stone I'm Red. May I take a glance at your compendium? Just a peak? Damn pills. She was losing it.</p>
            
                <p>OUT. OUT. OUT!</p>
            
                <p>“It was nice, not knowing you Nott. But, now I do. So erm- till next time, I suppose...” Or hopefully Nott. She wants to say it, but overkill.</p>
            
                <p>“It was lovely, little Goddess. Glad to see there's still some fire in there. Remember my offer." He offers a final parting smirk and wink, before striding past Malfoy and out of the compartment.</p>
            
                <p>Finally.</p>
            
                <p>However, Malfoy lingers. It's completely silent for a few moments, and Hermione's heart begins pounding in her chest. Is he going to hurt me? Kill me? She can't stop her incessant thoughts, so when he finally turns to face her she flinches. His steel-grey eyes meet hers, a palpable force that pins her to her seat.</p>
            
                <p>“Stay clear of Theo, Granger. He's my friend. Don't go ruining someone else's because you broke your own.”</p>
            
                <p>There's a swish of his robes, and the compartment door snaps shut.</p>
            
                <p>Prick.</p>
            
                <p>The sudden blow of long-awaited peace envelops her, she lies in a pool of numb tranquility.</p>
            
                <p>Bothered, who? Me? No, not ever again.</p>
            
                <p>I am color, I am rain, a Goddess whom from Zeus, I came.</p>
            
                <p>Hermione leans back, shifts her eyes closed, and allows herself to be claimed by a serene and dreamless sleep.</p>

            <h2> The Pheonix</h2>
            <div>
<p>The blaring of the train's whistle jolts Hermione from sleep. Spasms ricochet through her body on her ascent to consciousness, bringing about the slow return of sensation to her fingers and legs. Appendages accounted for, she goes about the painstaking task of prying her eyes open. A blur of mahogany comes into view and with it, the realization that her gaze is fixed heavenwards, to the ceiling.</p>

<p>Brain is mush, legs are lead, where is her neck? Slowly, oh so slowly, she begins to peel her spine from the upholstered bench. Finally, a creaky neck is accounted for among a mass of rickety bones. She reaches her hand to the back of her head and tentatively fingers the state of affairs. A ball of, something, is wedged behind her neck. And oh, God it's her hair. It's ..damp. Sigh.</p>

<p>Winding up all her strength and Gryffindor courage, she takes in her surroundings.</p>

<p>Blur, why is it so blurry?</p>

<p>Yellow.</p>

<p>Bright, blinding yellow, the most offending color she has ever seen, is across from her.</p>

<p>Hermione gathers all her brain power to muster a squint. Focus eyes. Focus. Two great, lime-green circular orbs swim into view. Then, a head. White hair-correction, albino blonde hair juts out from, Something…</p>

<p>Is that a cycling helmet?</p>

<p>There's only one logical answer to who exactly is sitting in front of her.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Luna.”</p>

<p>“Hi, Hermione”</p>

<p>“Luna? Erm- well, what are you wearing?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” Luna glances down at herself. “My raincoat. Quite a pleasant color, wouldn't you agree?”</p>

<p>Luna's eyes are still coveted by orbs, nevertheless, Hermione still pictures them twinkling.</p>

<p>“No Luna. On your head, your eyes...”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Silly me, these are my Spectrespecs. I've redesigned them, you see.” With a dainty fist, she knocks the white surface of the helmet. Once, twice. Thrice. “Complete and total Wrackspurt protection.”</p>

<p>Hermione wills a small, pleasant nod.</p>

<p>“Your compartment is full of them. I think you've disturbed a colony. They seem to have taken a liking to your hair. I've been cataloging their movements whilst you slept. It's fascinating to analyze them in such a vulnerable state. They're usually quite guarded, but your hair seems to provide some sort of refuge.”</p>

<p>Merlin. Was that supposed to be a compliment? An involuntary curl pulls slightly on Hermione's upper lip. She allows it persist for only one, teensy moment, before she schools her features, and offers a small, strenuous smile.</p>

<p>“As always Luna, I've missed your insights.”</p>

<p>Luna seems unaffected and continues her observations.</p>

<p>To Hermione's relief, commotion from the hall brings about a means of escape.</p>

<p>“Yes, well... As always, I'm happy to be of use in any academic pursuit. Now, I think we should collect our things. It seems everyone is disembarking.”</p>

<p>In one swift motion, she moves to gather her outer robes, retrieves her beaded bag from the bench, and secures it tightly around her wrist.</p>

<p>A loud pop seizes her attention. Luna begins uncorking a bottle containing a suspicious, green substance and swiftly downs the contents, effectively wafting putrid smells into the small compartment. Luna looks to Hermione with a broad smile, her teeth are stained green. Green! Hermione is horrified to discover Luna nudging another unopened bottle into her hand.</p>

<p>“A gift. From father and I. We made five batches for my return to Hogwarts. I made one for everyone.”</p>

<p>With wary acquiescence, Hermione's fingers gingerly pinch the neck of the bottle, reluctantly taking it from the strange girl.</p>

<p>“My thanks to you and Xenophilius. Um, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Gurdyroot Elixir.”</p>

<p>Hermione wrangles a full-body squirm. She feels something escape, and her eye twitches.</p>

<p>“Tastes best warm, as tea, but you can drink it however you'd like. Helps to keep the Wrackspurts away. You'd do best to drink it at every meal, they seem to love your hair and bag..” She resumes her habit of trailing off again, turns, and slides out the compartment door.</p>

<p>Hermione peers at the bottle now in her possession. The stopper is crusty and slightly sticky. Unsure of how to approach this, she murmurs a quick reducio, shrinking the item to the size of her finger, and tucks it into a very far and seldom thought-of corner of her beaded bag. Without dwelling further on the matter, she follows after Luna.</p>

<p>Aside from herself and Luna, the train seems to be deserted. She breathes a sigh of relief. Hopefully, this means she won't have to encounter any familiar faces, and perhaps she'll even manage to slip off the train and make her way to the castle, completely unnoticed. The distant sounds of voices become apparent and she knows her hopes are dashed. Growing closer, discernible shouting fills the air. Two voices, female. One, high pitched and shrill. The other… authoritative, passionate, with a matter-of-fact tone…</p>

<p>Ginny.</p>

<p>With a rather rude shove past Luna, Hermione scrambles down the steps of the train to find Ginny and Tracie Davis standing less than a meter apart, both visibly seething.</p>

<p>Ginny is a portrait of fury, her eyes are alight with a fire completely harmonious with the scarlet of her waves. Her anger is palpable, filling the space around her and enveloping the air with her ruby essence. Her countenance seems to emanate, 'I am Genevra Weasley, do not dare tempt me.' The grip of her wand is fierce at her side, ready, but not aimed.</p>

<p>Davis, on the other hand, appears panicked. She gesticulates wildly, flinging her arms about in dramatic, frantic waves as if attempting to rally a mob to her cause. As if anyone would support her in her decision to go head-to-head with the formidable Ginevra Weasley.</p>

<p>Hermione steps forward, preparing herself. She must do something.</p>

<p>However, a hand appears on her shoulder and a broad chest blocks her approach. Looking up, she takes in Neville's concerned gaze. He's wearing those blasted worried eyes again, which Hermione thinks, is rather exasperating. With a gentle push of his palm, he guides her back to where Luna and Parvati now stand and offers an explanation, “Tracie accused Ginny of attempting to shove Pucey down the train steps.”</p>

<p>Parvati interjects with pointed enthusiasm, “Now she's defending her boyfriend's honor by challenging Ginny to a duel.”</p>

<p>Hermione does not school her features as her mouth falls agape, “That's unbelievable, Ginny would thrash her.”</p>

<p>Neville laughs knowingly, “Yeah well, Davis is willing to take the fall for her boyfriend. Pucey plays seeker, as does Ginny. There's only one team for the seventh and eighth years, inter-house unity and all..”</p>

<p>Yet again, Hermione is taken aback, “Inter-house unity?”</p>

<p>Parvati, giddy with gossip, interjects once more in a low, conspiratorial tone, “There are whispers of a single Quidditch team for returning seventh and eighth years. Not sure of the specifics, but everyone's going on about it. Each house is trying to find a way to ensure their players have a spot on the team. So..” Pavarti motions toward the girls still arguing, “If you're caught dueling you're sacked from the team. Davis is trying to rid Ginny of her chance at becoming Seeker.”</p>

<p>Well, that explains...</p>

<p>With a renewed sense of purpose, Hermione sidesteps Neville and strides confidently up to Davis, “Ahem, Davis. Since you've taken it upon yourself to defend your boyfriend's honor, I'd like to be Ginny's representative. Ready your wand, I haven't got all night."</p>

<p>Tracie steps backward, apprehension etching her features. She resumes her flailing gestures toward Ginny, "But... It's her! I called her to a duel!"</p>

<p>Hermione's eye roll is practically audible. Rain begins to pour, yet she stands her ground, obstinate.</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all aware you're here on behalf of Pucey. Now, I've come on behalf of Ginny, so stop wringing her out, take up your wand, and focus on how you'll go about dueling me."</p>

<p>Draco stands motionless in the wet, squelching mud. His trousers and the hem of his robes are covered in thick grime. Rainwater trickles from the strands of his hair in delicate beads, tracing the gaunt lines of his cheekbones, pooling together to ricochet off his jaw in rivulets. He is transfixed by the cloudy-white eyes before him. With a huff, steam erupts from two bony nostrils, the force parting his hair back from his eyes.</p>

<p>Eyes, which, two years ago, could not perceive the creature in front of him.</p>

<p>Eyes, once faultless.</p>

<p>Eyes, now tarnished, from what he had witnessed, By what he had done.</p>

<p>A soft nudge at his arm derails him from his stupor. He finds Theo standing next to him. Wet, brown, mousy fringe is plastered about his forehead while he stares blankly at the creature before them both. “Everyone sees them now mate. Everyone.”</p>

<p>Draco swallows and nods.</p>

<p>“Come on now, time to join the others..”</p>

<p>With one last nudge, Theo strides toward the carriage doors and climbs in.</p>

<p>Looking back into the eyes of the Thestral, Draco breathes deeply. If he were to peer long enough into the eyes of the creature, he would have seen each death, every pair of eyes lost to darkness in his presence.</p>

<p>So instead, he swiftly turns on his heel and stalks toward the carriage.</p>

<p>Draco slips into the shelter of the carriage and produces a silent drying charm with his wand. He settles onto the bench and glances up to find Theo sporting his most ostentatious smile, "I would recommend a Scourgify too, mate. Your hem is abysmal."</p>

<p>Less than a minute in the carriage and Draco can already feel irritation prickling under his skin, "Washing is the only acceptable possibility; charms thin the thread. By now, I'd expect you to comprehend these concepts, Theo. Your grandfather practically wrote that damned pureblood handbook that forced the knowledge of 'proper garment care' onto me as 'necessary education' for all of us miserable heirs. Had to learn that rubbish at seven, the most excruciatingly dull lessons, and I blame you."</p>

<p>Theo raises a brow.</p>

<p>"Pah! Oh yes, thread preservation. At the top of my priority list. And for your information, I never had to learn 'proper garment care.' Father said, and I quote, 'That's what elves are for, you Nit,' when the governess tried to teach it to me. Anyway, I'd rather roll with the swine than continue with the inbred concepts cherished by a certain Cantankerous Nott."</p>

<p>Draco narrows his eyes, "Trust me, I couldn't agree more with your sentiments. But why do you continue to treat me like I'm some shifty Overlord? Are you to be a tosser all year?"</p>

<p>Theo's retort is a bitter murmur, "If you keep keeping tabs on me like some kind of lost puppy, I just might."</p>

<p>Blaise lets out a snort, “And I thought Pansy was bad.”</p>

<p>Both Draco and Theo's eyes drift toward the woman tucked into the far corner of the carriage her face pressed against the window, showing no sign of having overheard. With a lurch forward the carriage departs, and all four passengers carry on in silence.</p>

<p>The Great Hall appears resplendent as if no war had taken place within these same stone walls. Glittering candles descend from the charmed roof and illuminate the scene above, storm clouds and rain. Floating instruments carry forth mellifluous hymns as if attempting to fabricate a state of serenity. Four familiar banners rest above each table, beckoning students to their place of refuge.</p>

<p>She allows her gaze to flit across the room and eyes the stretch of stone where Remus, Tonks, and Fred once lay prone, lifeless. It is plain, devoid of the death that once imbued this place, and it just feels wrong. Pausing, in an attempt to gather herself, she squeezes her eyes shut.</p>

<p>Get it together Hermione. Just get through tonight.</p>

<p>She allows one moment to pass before she opens them again and banishes the distressing thoughts. In her state of renewed clarity, she takes note of an unfamiliar table situated at the far end of the hall. It is set perpendicular to the other four tables, seemingly plain and lacking decorum. Odd.</p>

<p>There is a sudden prod to her right rib. She looks about warily and finds Dean falling into step beside her. Wonderful.</p>

<p>“Can't believe you almost dueled Tracie Davis, Hermione. You are a right lioness.”</p>

<p>“Meow,” comes Seamus Finnegan now on her left flank.</p>

<p>Rolling her eyes for what seems like the umpteenth time, she realises belatedly this habit is going to persist ad nauseam.</p>

<p>She attempts ignorance and finds a place amongst the Gryffindor table. Ginny and Neville take positions on either side of her, enclosing her as if she is a flighty fledgling attempting to flee the nest.</p>

<p>Seamus and Dean settle opposite from them, and Seamus prattles on, “That Davis is a right pillock, shoulda done it, Hermione. Shoulda folded her body in two, stuffed her into a trunk, and sent her right back to the station.”</p>

<p>Ginny turns toward Hermione with a clear and intense expression, “We can't have you gallivanting the countryside going about defending my honour. I love you Hermione, and I would've been pleased to see Davis's head coming out her arse, but I'm really glad you didn't go after her.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small shrug, “I wasn't actually going to hex her.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know that. I'm just glad to have you on my side.”</p>

<p>Both girls exchange a small smile. Ginny discreetly clasps Hermione's hand under the table, giving it a tight squeeze.</p>

<p>A voice booms throughout the hall, ending their heart-to-heart, “STUDENTS! ATTENTION!”</p>

<p>All eyes lift toward the podium where Hagrid towers, seemingly surprised by his shocking cadence. He reddens and steps aside. McGonagall gives him a slight nod and approaches the podium.</p>

<p>She is draped in violet robes with a trail of morning glories adorning her hem. Keen eyes settled behind dainty spectacles scan the throng of students. Her eyes briefly land on Hermione's before flittering away. She lifts her chin and begins,</p>

<p>“I am gracious to be standing amongst you all tonight. We have been through many hardships in the course of the last few years. Many of you have faced trials that no witch or wizard, let alone children, should ever have had to endure. I do not say this lightly, I am most proud of my students here at Hogwarts. We will not ignore all that has happened; Our triumph over darkness was not without its many terrible losses. And for those, we mourn.”</p>

<p>McGonagall bows her head in respect for a few moments before proceeding,</p>

<p>“We have gathered here, in the castle that in many ways, sent each of you in directions imposed on you by your parents, your elders. Today we stand together once more. You, dear students, are the future of the Wizarding World. You now have a choice, a decision to shape it according to your vision. I am incredibly proud of every student who has chosen to join me and all our dedicated professors in returning to Hogwarts. This year will be marked by understanding, progress, and unity. Hereby, I would like to introduce a novel and transient house, a house whose namesake is inspired by our most noble headmasters: Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape. Both wizards were vital to the war's outcome, sacrificing their reputations and lives for righteousness. This house erected in their honour, will be comprised of seventh years and those returning for their eighth year. It will be known as the House of the Phoenix. From ashes, you will rise, and death shall not be proud, for you all have conquered.”</p>

<p>She gestures to the back of the hall, to the odd table placed perpendicular to the others. From above, a banner descends gracefully, its fabric rippling to unveil a flaming gold Phoenix set against a backdrop of deep violet. Atop the table, a runner appears adorned in the same violet hue, intricately embroidered with gold, it shimmers against the dark wooden surface.</p>

<p>McGonagall outstretches her arm toward the opulent display, “Students please welcome, the House of Phoenix.”</p>

<p>Stillness sweeps over the Great Hall like a seismic wave. Hermione is knocked from level ground and plunged into the abyss. Her ears are ringing amidst the piercing silence. What is happening? Amidst her disorientation, she vaguely hears Professor McGonagall continue,</p>

<p>“I would now ask that all seventh years and returning eighth years rise from their previous houses and conjoin at your new house table.”</p>

<p>Not one person stirs in response. Hermione is still plunging: down, down, down. The ringing in her head multiples. Instinctively her hand twitches toward her beaded bag.</p>

<p>Too much. This is too much. Why couldn't we have a normal year, for once?</p>

<p>The moment persists for an eternity. A “bloody ridiculous” emanates from somewhere, Hermione immediately thinks, Slytherin. At last, movement stirs to Hermione's right.</p>

<p>Neville rises, swings his leg over the bench, and strides purposefully toward the back table. Seconds pass, and then another figure emerges from Hufflepuff. Luna Lovegood breezes down the aisle toward the back table. Following her lead is Lavender Brown, her appearance notably disheveled compared to previous years and Parvati trails her from behind. Next, three from Ravenclaw: Cho Chang, Mandy Brocklehurst, and Padma. Michael Corner follows suit.</p>

<p>Across the table from her, Dean and Seamus exchange glances before shrugging and joining in the procession. Soon it is a flurry of movement as every seventh and eighth year convene at the back table. The only remaining Gryffindor's are Hermione and Ginny.</p>

<p>Hermione takes note that not one Slytherin has yet to make a move as well. A nudge to her side waylays her thoughts and she makes eye contact with the fiery redhead at her side,</p>

<p>“Come on Hermione, sod it.” And with that, Ginny rises and swaggers down the aisle.</p>

<p>Hermione glances toward the podium again and is met with those keen eyes and a highly arched, expecting brow.</p>

<p>Sod it. Sod it. Sod it ALL.</p>

<p>Swinging her leg over the bench she aims her gaze at an empty stretch of seating near the end. She avoids the many eyes set on her, approaches the table and awkwardly lowers herself onto the bench.</p>

<p>To everyone's surprise and enunciated by several audible gasps, Pansy Parkinson is the first to rise from Slytherin. Head down She rushes toward the Phoenix table. Blaise Zabini jumps up and strides after her. Then Slytherin after Slytherin rises, albeit begrudgingly, until the only remaining eighth years are Nott and Malfoy.</p>

<p>Finally, Theo raises his arms in an arching stretch and proceeds to climb from the Slytherin bench.</p>

<p>In the strain of the silence Malfoy drawls, “Et tu, Brute?”, loud enough for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>Theo turns to Malfoy and shrugs, “Slytherin has done shite for me.”</p>

<p>With that, he pads toward the Phoenix table.</p>

<p>Hermione currently finds her place setting quite riveting. She does not take notice of the two menacing brown eyes currently drilling holes in the back of her head.</p>

<p>Something within her squirms the moment she senses a familiar impetuous presence behind her. Turning, she finds Theo and his damned smirk. His tousled waves fall about his forehead and he shakes his head like a wet dog.</p>

<p>“Hello again, little Goddess. Mind if I take a seat next to my new favorite housemate?”</p>

<p>Hermione summons her most sardonic grin, preparing her quip, only to be spared from such glories by none other than Malfoy. Theodore is utterly unprepared to defend himself against the book that comes hurtling at his head, resulting in a loud thud upon contact with his 'impeccable' hair. Malfoy, the truculent menace, (or saviour?) begins hauling him by the shoulder toward the other end of the table, where the other Slytherins now cluster together like a flock of sheep.</p>

<p>McGonagall carries on, “Thank you all for your cooperation. Now, let us commence forth with the sorting of the first years!” With that McGonagall carries on with the usual Hogwarts welcome back customs."</p>

<p>Hermione, along with the rest of the Phoenix, seems disinterested in such frivolities. The entire table sits in silence throughout the sorting ceremony, the performance of the Hogwarts song, and the feast. Staring down at the untouched green pudding in front of her, Hermione is suddenly interrupted by a loud, throaty cough.</p>

<p>All heads swivel to the far end of the table, where she once sat in solitude. Following the many gazes with her own, she beholds a peculiar elderly man standing just to the right of her. He wears round, oversized spectacles, which make his green sparkling eyes appear two times larger than what is normally considered 'proportionally pleasing'. His spectacles perch on a long, pointy nose just above a sparsely mustachioed lip, slightly shaven on the left, revealing a large, dull mole. He hunches over a cane, teetering dangerously to the side, his bald head reflecting light like a beacon, causing Hermione to wince, the glare piercing the back of her eyelids.</p>

<p>Despite his kind and bright eyes, there's a sense of mischief about him. He coughs his last, producing a hacking and painful sound, and speaks in a rickety voice, “House of Phoenix students, follow me to your dormitory.” With that, he turns swiftly and skips out of the hall.</p>

<p>Hermione exchanges a glance with Ginny down the table, receiving a gleam of excitement in return.</p>

<p>Everyone hurries after the old man, catching up to him on the staircase where he leans over his cane, heaving great gulping breaths. His pace now snail-like, inches him forward at an excruciating rate. After a few moments, like a toy with a new cell, he skips off again. This pattern is repeated intermittently. Hermione finds the whole ordeal reminiscent of one of her favorite childhood tales, Aesop's Fable, 'The Tortoise and the Hare'. He is both Tortoise and Hare, simultaneously. Her mind drifts to Lord Dunsany's version of the tale, and she inwardly recites “a glorious victory for the forces of swiftness”, when he finally reaches the 7th floor.</p>

<p>The old man paces along the wall that previously housed the Room of Requirement, and to Hermione's dismay, appears to be attempting to conjure the door.</p>

<p>No. No. No.</p>

<p>Hermione is a deer, stunned, unmoving. Her mouth is parched. Her hands are clammy. Her voice cracks as she releases a mortifying shriek, “STOP!”</p>

<p>Turning slowly, the old man's eyes meet her own, questioningly.</p>

<p>She stutters, somewhat abashed at her nerve, “Um, you- you can't open it. It was destroyed… With fiendfyre.”</p>

<p>The only response and warning she receives is an impish wink. A door materializes behind him and he reaches for the shimmering handle, yanking it open. Hermione's heart stammers in her chest as she braces herself for the barrage of flames. However, to her surprise, none come. Instead, golden light drifts into the corridor, casting long shadows onto the walls behind the students, who stand peering at the open door, dumbstruck.</p>

<p>Hermione is shocked. How? How? How is this possible? She'd seen the flames herself. She felt the scorching ribbons brush her brow. She watched as Crabbe was swallowed whole by the inferno. How? She needs to know.</p>

<p>Another seems to be grappling with similar incredulity, “How?”</p>

<p>She turns, curious as to who produced the query, and finds Malfoy directly behind her, his jaw tight, eyes fixated on the door.</p>

<p>In response, the old man offers a toothy grin. “Fiendfyre: volatile, perilous, nearly impossible to be rid of. Yet, I know a secret” he pushes forward in a conspiratorial tone, “I've learned a strong Finite Incantatem does well enough in most cases.” Hermione's jaw falls off its hinge. There is no way...</p>

<p>Dismissing the unabashed gawking of the students, he carries on, “Without further ado, the Phoenix dormitories! Password is DoxyDung. I trust you will not go about chanting it in the corridors; might offend some rather prickly creatures.”</p>

<p>He gives another surreptitious wink and somehow his grin grows wider, “I am to be your head of house and strapping new, Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.” With this, he attempts a bow so low Hermione is afraid he might keel over.</p>

<p>“Professor NeatWanker at your service!”</p>

<p>Absolute silence. Everyone is afraid to dare breathe. To her right, Dean nudges Seamus with a whisper, “NeatWanker? Old geezer's setting himself up for a good ribbing.”</p>

<p>Seamus's left eye twitches, he looks tortured. His lips are pinched together, face reddening with the pass of each second.</p>

<p>Dean continues, “He's a literal wanker, Where'd they even find this codger? Went and Plucked him straight from the bloody tomb?”</p>

<p>Professor NeatWanker whirls his head towards Dean with exuberance, “Think I still got a few years left, wouldn't you say?” He demonstrates this by promptly breaking into a lively Irish step dance, using his cane to push himself off the ground at each arching leap.</p>

<p>Seamus the Tomato, erupts. His knee-slapping, elbow-jabbing, foot-trampling, and ear-splitting affairs claim several victims, including Hermione's foot.</p>

<p>Considering this most riveting performance and her freshly bruised toe, Hermione finds herself drained. She can't be bothered to handle any more unpredicted happenings for the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Belatedly, the students file into the dormitory and find themselves welcomed by a large room lit by candlelight, with vast couches adorning the center of the room in front of a roaring hearth. Each side of the hearth is lined by two staircases, which Hermione surmises, lead to the boys' and girls' dormitories. Without hesitation, she presses onward, climbing the staircase situated to the right. Arriving at the top, she casts her gaze over the row of doors. A surge of relief floods through her when she spots her name shimmering, charmed to glitter in her presence, upon one of them. With a steady hand, she grasps the doorknob and pushes open the door to refuge.</p>

            <h2> Hence, These Tears</h2>
            <div>
<p>The reflection in the mirror has become far too familiar: hallowed cheeks, dull, lifeless eyes, and purple bags. Lips that pull slightly downward reveal a perpetual frown.</p>

<p>Impassive, soulless, a shell of his former self.</p>

<p>Draco observes himself through the one-way window of his mind. He assesses the image clinically, he should take better care of his appearance. He must convey composure, even if it feels futile. Anyone could be watching. He knows they lie in wait for the moment he falters, cracks. The moment he loses his shit or whatever it is they expect from him. He needs to stay vigilant.</p>

<p>He recalls Robards, practically salivating during the hearing, eager to drag him to Azkaban like he did his father. However, Draco was unyielding, he gave them nothing, not a twitch. When the allegations were presented, he stood there, chained to the floor like the disobedient dog they were itching to make of him. They wanted him to cower, to beg. He gave no contest to his culpability. Fixating his eyes on the Wizengamot and staring them down, he silently declared, 'I don't give a damn about what you do with me'. He was ready for his fate and had accepted it. That is, until Potter and Granger turned up, delivering their ludicrous testimonies, portraying him as some sad and helpless whelp, dubbing him a 'misguided youth' who had been under duress.</p>

<p>After days of interrogation and contentious debates, those two stalked into the courtroom, and like clockwork, he was acquitted the same day, albeit with just a year of academic probation. The defense, from two of the “Golden Trio”, made him look pathetic. Rita published that damn article, insinuating he'd paid them off. Fucking twat. Like he'd be so desperate.</p>

<p><i>Calm down.</i></p>

<p>He reminds himself that this is exactly why he has to stay behind the safe walls of his Occlumency. His father's shame. That scornful drawl echoes through his mind: “You're too emotional, boy”, “You'll always be soft” and “Your passions are disgraceful, restrain yourself, Draco”.</p>

<p>An eye in the mirror twitches.</p>

<p><i>Why does it always come back to him?</i></p>

<p><i>Stop.</i></p>

<p>He re-centers himself.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year. A chant, a Prayer.</i></p>

<p>After this, he's leaving the continent. He's taking everyone he has left: Mother and Theo. This is the goal, the only thing that's keeping him from falling apart. His grip tightens on the edge of the sink and he leans down. His mind drifting towards her… Mother… Mother who is wasting away in the manor, biding her time in house arrest, staring out the large windows of the conservatory, surrounded by countless acres, utterly alone.</p>

<p>The walls crumble.</p>

<p>Draco eyes the reflection in the mirror, and the tears begin to cascade, streaking down his gaunt cheeks. His mind drifts away…</p>

<p>Tears, from a different time streaming, warm arms cradling him tightly, his head wedged in the crook of a neck…</p>

<p>Father had gone 'on business”. It was always a vague, brief declaration, Draco pondered it a few times, Father didn't have a job, had he? At any rate, he was Lord Lucius Malfoy, so Draco troubled himself no further.</p>

<p>It was spring, Mother approved his plea of having breakfast on the terrace in the east wing. He munched on bacon and observed the battle of winter and spring: Cold air wound up his legs, nipping at him ferociously, erupting goosebumps in its wake. Then, sunlight erupted like a warrior lying in wait, piercing the cold with his bronze grip. The war raged on… Draco chewed on, laughing and steeped in wonderment.</p>

<p>When father was away, he was permitted to wear whatever he so desired, and he always opted for play clothes. They made him feel free. He slid down the banisters in his loose shorts, snuck into the elves' chambers with dusty sleeves, rolled down the grassy hills with wild hair, and chased the peacocks in worn trainers. He was liberated, he could breathe.</p>

<p>Despite his mother's coddling and leniency, he couldn't help his diminishing behavior. He had his tantrums, became reckless, and sought out trouble. He couldn't help it. The available air was overwhelming, it was exhilarating, it was sublime. Father would return, and it would end. Thinking of it made him anxious, so he grabbed at anything he could and held on for dear life.</p>

<p>After his bacon-exclusive meal, he climbed the manor walls, clinging to the lattice and vines. The leaves scratched at his bare arms as he lugged his broom up with him; The broom, his mother referred to as being, 'twice his size', but to Draco's glee, father had insisted he have. He hadn't actually flown it yet, it was too big and hefty. It wouldn't take off the ground, or at least not from the ground, he reasoned. Thus, he was standing on the roof, over the east tower, with the broom between his legs. He could see his untouched porridge on the terrace below, by now, likely cold and thickened. He peered into the distance, at the mist rising from the lake's surface from the warm rays of sunlight. He wanted to brush against it, to twirl the mist in his fingertips.</p>

<p>He held onto that thought and leapt.</p>

<p>The spiral downward made his stomach swoop, the bacon was back in his throat. He jerked the broom, up, up, up. It complied for a moment before dipping again. The war between boy and broom, spring and winter, freedom and captivity, raged on as always. Finally, broom met tree and his grip slipped. He plunged through the branches which seemed to reach for him, only slightly slowing his descent. At last, his back hit the ground. His leg, dawned in his play shorts made a sharp snap. A cry reverberated through him. With a small pop, Dobby was there, gathering him and muttering something akin to, “Oh master Draco, Dobby is so sorry. Dobby will take you to Mistress.”</p>

<p>He was placed in warm arms. Tears streaked down his cheeks, wails and hiccuping came forth from his lips. Dobby healed his leg, Though, his cries still carried on.</p>

<p>Still cradled in soft arms, he was rocked soothingly, “Shh, my love. My sweet, daring child. You are so brave, so valiant.” She swayed with him for long, countless moments. Eventually, he ceased his cries and met her eyes.</p>

<p>“There he is. My perfect boy. I have you now. All is well.” In his mother's arms, Draco could breathe. She rocked him until his head found its place in her neck, until his eyes fluttered close.</p>

<p>That night, father returned early, and with him, his reckoning. Play clothes were banished, broom met <i>incendio</i>, Dobby was beaten. And of Draco's punishment, father never left again.</p>

<p><i>One year. Only this one year.</i></p>

<p>Pounding at the bathroom door startles him to his senses. He straightens and stiffens. Tears cease, eyes tighten, and walls rise once more.</p>

<p>“On with it! Take the piss already! No use just staring at it! You've been in there for ages, Draco! Unless.. It's not a piss you're taking... You know what, never mind, I'll use the common room loo, you constipated Bowtruckle.”</p>

<p>Five in the morning and the prat is awake. Draco whirls, ripping open the door.</p>

<p>“Why, in Merlin's name are you awake? I purposefully woke at five in the bloody morning as to avoid your ghastly voice.”</p>

<p>“Hush I know you're cranky, Draco but you know you love me, I'm irresistible.”</p>

<p>“Please, piss off. You're growing intolerable. I might just leave you behind when I'm through with this place.”</p>

<p>Draco pads to his bed to retrieve his satchel, heads toward the door and walks briskly out. As he heads down the stairs, Theo follows.</p>

<p>“You know you wouldn't do that. Then I'd be all alone. I'd probably become some kind of mobster, making deals with vampires and that sort. I'm too much like my father when I'm lonely... Who is going to take care of me? I can't bear to think of it. Growing old in that cold, dank manor, with spiderwebs in my sock drawer, sporting long fingernails and crusty lips. Eugh... If that ever is my fate, please just kill me.”</p>

<p>They reach the common room and pause. Sitting on a sofa in the far corner is Lavender Brown. She sports a high turtleneck and is staring out a

 window, seemingly unaware of their presence.</p>

<p>Theo whispers none too discreetly, “Shite, thought she was dead.”</p>

<p>He makes a gesture with his hand feigning slicing his throat, his eyes move to the back of his head and his tongue, slackened, spills out of his unhinged jaw.</p>

<p>Immediately, Brown whips her head around to face the two. Fortunately, Theo does seem to have a wit stashed deep under that thick head of his. He collects himself, turns back to Draco, and begins loudly proclaiming, “Bread, Draco! I need bread! Silly nutter, you. Itchy throat, remember? Does the trick. Ah, I've gotta go, to-erm.. take that piss I was telling you about... Yea, okay see you, bye…”</p>

<p>Loud thumping is followed as Theo dashes back up the stairs. Draco simply turns and continues toward the exit.</p>

<p>He thinks he'll head to the library, just to study a bit, and prepare. Then, he'll grab a quick breakfast from the Great Hall, he needs to pack some meat back on his bones and fill out the gauntness. Then, off to potions. It's a good plan. Solid.</p>

<p>Hand on the door, he turns and eyes the back of Lavender Brown's head, she's still sitting on the couch, facing the window. He looks through it too, the sun is new in the sky, and rays stream down onto the landscape below. The lake lies peacefully still and mist billows from its surface.</p>

<p>On second thought, maybe he'll take a ride on his broom. After all, he's already donning his leisure wear under his robes.</p>

<hr>

<p>The first day of classes and she's late. Never has Hermione Jean Granger been late for anything. Taking two steps at a time, she rushes down the stairs to the dungeons for potions. A loud growl reverberates through her, causing her to momentarily teeter on a step. God, it's her stomach. Disturbed, she points her wand at the responsible organ and mutters a <i>silencio</i>.</p>

<p>Having missed out on breakfast, she's famished. And now she realizes she had scarcely eaten anything the evening before either. Frizzy hair whips into her eyes. She had no time to plait it. Her robes are wrinkled and askew, and she didn't even have a moment to brush her teeth. She quickly whips out her wand in her descent and performs a quick <i>Scourgify</i> on her mouth. It stings slightly and leaves a residual feeling of uncleanliness, but at least her breath won't reek.</p>

<p>How, how did she let this happen?</p>

<p>Memories of the previous evening are in shards and pieces. She remembers finding her room, claiming a bed, healing her foot, and pulling the canopy curtains closed. The rest is fuzzy.</p>

<p>Fragments rise: in her search for the balm, she discovered a vial of Draft of Peace at the bottom of her bag. Probably from her last medical run while camping with Harry and Ron. She needs to find a moment to clean it out. She's still carrying that damned tent, too. She had taken the draught and then her medications. Shit she had taken both. She remembers floating in a pool of bliss, staring at the canopy ceiling. She was cocooned, safe.</p>

<p>Shit. She was high as a bloody kite.</p>

<p>Her mind is racing as she slips into class. Everyone is standing, lined around the room as Slughorn makes his announcements, thankfully he doesn't seem to notice her slipping in late.</p>

<p>“…Having said that, when you're seated please join your partner in prepping your ingredients for our first potion, sleeping draught.”</p>

<p>Hermione leans in towards Padma, whom she had squeezed in next to upon entering.</p>

<p>“What's going on?”</p>

<p>Padma eyes her suspiciously and then seems to think better of it, whispering, “Well, Slughorn has seating assignments for potions this year.”</p>

<p>“What? Why would he do that?"</p>

<p>“He said it was due to the inter-house unity initiative, McGonagall is taking it all very seriously.”</p>

<p>Padma's name is called then and Slughorn has her take a seat next to Blaise Zabini. Slughorn continues.</p>

<p>“Pansy Parkinson, Neville Longbottom, right here next to the cabinets. Don't let anyone go about taking anything without using the inventory system. Hogwarts does not have endless resources, students! However, if you or your families would like to donate to our potion stores, please see me after class. A wonderful opportunity for academic endorsement! Now where were we? Oh, yes! Luna Lovegood, Draco Malfoy here…”</p>

<p>He carries on and Hermione's mind drifts towards the previous night again. Mixing Draft of Peace and her medications seemed to produce a heightened sense of euphoria, One she had never experienced before. Moonstone, Hellebore, Mandrake, Unicorn Horn, Porcupine quills. Combining muggle pharmaceuticals with potions is unexplored and highly volatile. This all needs to be evaluated later. Suddenly her name is called and she steps forward.</p>

<p>“And Theodore Nott, right across the aisle from Lovegood and Malfoy please.”</p>

<p>Hermione blanches. Oh, God. NO. She steps to her seat and sits discreetly. Maybe if she comes off as withdrawn or strange, he'll leave her alone. Theodore sits in the chair beside her and turns his whole body toward her so that the full force of him is facing her. Hard Luck. She looks up and he's smiling. It's the worst, most awful, unfortunately, warm and radiant smile.</p>

<p>“Who in the heavens did I so please? My new best friend, now housemate, AND assigned potions partner? Glorious, oh glorious!”</p>

<p>More like damned, damned, damned.</p>

<p>Hermione's gaze locks onto two piercing grey eyes across the aisle and over Theo's shoulder. Great, now she's on Malfoy's hit list. Move over Harry, Undesirable No. 1. is now Hermione Jean Granger. Setting up the Cauldron, Hermione groans to Theodore, “Why are you always so chipper?”</p>

<p>“What, would you rather I brood like dearest comrade Draco?”</p>

<p>They both peek at the sickly-looking man leaning over his cauldron across the aisle. He whips his piercing glare back at Hermione and appears to be attempting to <i>incendio</i> her hair. An <i>aguamenti</i> lingers on the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>Hermione swallows, “ Erm-no, I suppose that would be... worse.”</p>

<p>Again, Theo shares his radiant smile, “That's what I thought. You love me, for who I am. And I love you for you too.”</p>

<p>“That's nice.” Not knowing how to respond to that, she hands him the Flobberworm mucus and he begins measuring out the quantity with precision.</p>

<p>“You know, I've been thinking... Since you're no longer in Gryffindor, The title Gryffindor Princess doesn't seem to be suitable. It doesn't check the boxes, fill the bill, It's a “lights are in but nobody's home situation”.</p>

<p>“Excuse me?” Hermione drops the vial of wormwood essence but saves it from spilling.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“How you still have your arms and legs with that mouth of yours, is beyond me. It's going to bring about your assassination.”</p>

<p>“Ooh, that implies anticipation and mystery, makes me seem relevant.” he winks, “Anyhow, what does that phrase mean, exactly? You see, I was bored out of my wits over the summer: abusive daddy imprisoned for life and all. I have that entire horrid manor all to myself. So I thought I'd take a stroll to my neighborhood muggle pub. You know, burying said hatchet and the like. I told myself, hey, be neighborly, Theo. The pub is about a three-kilometer stroll from the manor, had to charm my oxfords with cushioning charms! Anyway, a few hours later, I finally made it to the pub. I ran into a family of squirrels and.. well.. actually that's a story for later, please do not derail me. Anyway, I made it to the pub and downed three ghastly pints of something called 'spout'”</p>

<p>Hermione interrupts, “Stout?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes! See, friends are quite convenient.” Another wink, “Now let me continue, I drink three of these dark and dubious substances and find I'm utterly sloshed! I go to pay and the Barman looks at me like I'm mad! Then I realized I was trying to pay with Galleons! Galleons at a Muggle pub, Hermione! Oh, silly me! When I handed him the coins, he turned to his workfellow and uttered that phrase, you know, '

The lights are on but nobody's home.' I said, 'I do not dabble with electrons; I use candlelight. Or torches when I feel so inclined.' I attempted to explain that I didn't have pounders, but I would rush home, Floo to Gringotts, make the exchange, Floo back home, and then hurry back to the pub with his pounders in tow.”</p>

<p>Hermione, mouth agape in horror, hands the Valerian sprigs to Theo, listening intently whilst she absently grinds the asphodel petals.</p>

<p>“Oh don't look at me like that Hermione, I was plastered! I was trying to fix it. Thought I'd give him the truth. He didn't believe me anyway, He reached over the bar, grabbed me by the lapels, and began shaking me like the muggle coins would fall out of my pockets! This, this is when I knew I was, how you say, 'with a pickle'”</p>

<p>“In, IN a pickle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, semantics, paramount information..." he rolls his eyes, "All things considered, I was able to scamper off unscathed! Only had to hand over my pocket watch and jacket, which I didn't mind, as it was already a wrinkled mess. Oh and my shoes, now that was the worst of it, as I had to walk back those three kilometers, sloshed AND barefoot!”</p>

<p>Hermione erupted in laughter, “Oh my God Theo, you're an absolute pillock! How in Merlin's name are you still alive? Breathing?”</p>

<p>“Exactly! This is what I've been trying to tell you! I'm a helpless, incompetent fellow. I need, need need, an intelligent, skilled, formidable goddess as a friend, at my side. Otherwise, I'm utterly hopeless.”</p>

<p>“You know… I suppose you aren't so bad, Theodore Nott.”</p>

<p>He gleams, “I'm really Not.”</p>

<p>Professor Slughorn approaches their table, "Oh wonderful! Ms. Granger, Mr. Nott, Delightful work. What a pair these two!” Nevilles and Pansy's cauldron begins boiling over and Slughorn rushes off.</p>

<p>Theo eyes her questioningly and Hermione gives a small nod. “Yes, Nott. Friends. We can be friends.”</p>

<p>“Great! I cannot wait for all the trouble we will get up to.” He gives her another playful wink and they continue on their tasks.</p>

<p>Hermione feels a kind of warmth from Theo. He has a depth about him, It's something that he seems to want to hide from everyone. She knows this because she's the same way. He's suffered, this is certain. He's alluded to his father too many times for it not to be some kind of wound. He is complex, a book with many of the pages stuck together. She doesn't mind helping to peel some of them apart.</p>

<hr>

<p>After Ancient Runes, she finally finds herself a moment of peace. She allows her feet to lead her to a part of Hogwarts she knows she'll be left alone. On the fourth floor, down a far and forgotten corridor lies a small courtyard. It boasts a tranquil fountain and several sculptures of headless baroque figures portraying dramatic, sensuous movements. She walks around one of these, trailing her fingers across the thigh of a man in supplication, to her bench. She rounds the statue and is abruptly aware of a figure already seated, writing in a journal, Malfoy.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry. I didn't know you were here.”</p>

<p>He doesn't lift his head from the journal, “Well now you know, off with you.”</p>

<p>What an absolute little prick. She stomps her foot down, refusing to entertain him. “Actually, you know what, you get out. This is my spot, I've been coming here since the fifth year.”</p>

<p>He still refuses to spare her a glance, “I thought that moldy corner in the back of the library was 'your spot'. And no, I've been coming here since third.“</p>

<p>“It is not moldy!” He's not wrong, it can be a little humid from time to time, but it's the only part of the library no one ever roams. One of the few places she knows she won't be disturbed.</p>

<p>Finally, he meets her eye. “It's damp, Granger. All the books in the vicinity are waterlogged. It's Probably why your hair is so frizzy and maybe even why that stick slid so far up your arse.” He gives a small, devious smirk.</p>

<p>What the fuck?? She strides toward him, hovering above him while he's still seated. “Fuck you Malfoy. I punched you once and I will punch you again. No daddy to tell on either.”</p>

<p>He stands then and towers over her. She takes a step back, “What the fuck did you just say?” He steps forward, closing the distance between them again. When he speaks, his voice is low and authoritative, “The only reason I'm not rotting in Azkaban with him, as I should be, is because of you and that self-righteous hero complex of yours. Next time, keep that nose of yours in your soggy books and out of my business.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, they were going to put you in Azkaban. Harry and I... We couldn't just let that happen. You're no angel, obviously, but you were still just a child, dragged through it all.”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a child?” He stands above her and she swallows with trepidation.</p>

<p>“No. Not anymore, but- but you were. And you didn't identify Harry at the manor. I don't know why not, Malfoy. But you didn't, nonetheless. Everyone needed to know that. The things they were saying about you before- well, you didn't deserve it. I couldn't keep that on my conscious, watching you get sent there, at least not without sharing the truth first.”</p>

<p>“I'm not some pity case, Granger. I did not ask anything of you. I would never. Just- just stop acting like your a fucking savior like Potter, stop fixing everything and everyone. You're nothing without your awards and accolades. You're just a-“</p>

<p>“A filthy mudblood.”</p>

<p>He winces, “That's - that is not what I was going to say. Don't put words in my mouth.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, those words have been in and out of your mouth from the moment you stepped on the train, all those years ago.”</p>

<p>“Yea, I'm shit, Granger, I know..” He's still staring down at her, and she sees something in his eyes slip and falter. It's an imperceptible change, something you'd have to be staring at intently to notice, and she does. It's then she realizes that the world is shit. Everyone is in so much pain, all suffering in their own ways.</p>

<p>“Just forget it, Malfoy. The spot is yours.” Finally, she breaks their gaze, turns, and walks away.</p>

<hr>

<p>She's adrift, the tide pulls her, in and out. In and out.</p>

<p>She succumbs, no, embraces this.</p>

<p>The tide, the pull.</p>

<p>Leading her to open water, to the deep, blue abyss.</p>

<p>To comfort.</p>

<p>It is a river to the unknown. To being and un-being. She lets the unseen river guide her. She will not fight this, it is this feeling, the rich and sweet, which is real, absolute. The pull of it is viscous like honey, delightful and heady. She is beguiled, bewitched. The emptiness, the fullness, all at once. It is warm, like home…</p>

<p>Eyes open and dark coils are strewn across an extending arm. Fingers curl around an empty potion vial, sky blue capsules lie amongst white linens.</p>

<p>Eyes look toward the heavens to violet and gold drapes, spinning and swirling, round and round. she joins.</p>

<p>Round and round. A carousel. How Beautiful.</p>

<p>She remembers then…The small world spinning, everything was smaller then.</p>

<p>Simple.</p>

<p>Mannequin horses bobbing, up and down. Laughter. A woman with bouncing curls, smiling up at a man with pure adoration in his gaze. A kiss to the temple.</p>

<p>Woman and Man.</p>

<p>Mother and Father.</p>

<p>Strangers.</p>

<p>Dead.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force rips her away, she's whisked into oblivion, all alone.</p>

<p>Child.</p>

<p>Daughter.</p>

<p>Orphan.</p>

<p>Still adrift. Forgotten, left behind…</p>

<p>When will this make sense? When will it all just end? She had tried. Tried to do it all right. She sacrificed everything. So why did she deserve this? Was it all for not

?</p>

<p>It's too much again, so she lets go, it's easier to let it all go. The current claims her with its assuring arms, so she surrenders, it's the only thing she can do.</p>

<p>Eyes close once more. Darkness comes to her again, a friend, her Casanova... She lies in wait for this forbidden lover and once again, renders herself whole when she feels its embrace.</p>

            <h2>L'appel Du Vide</h2>
            <div>
                <p>“Welcome to Defense Against the Dark Arts: NeatWanker style!” Professor NeatWanker's oversized eyes attempt a wink, but only produce a constrained squint.</p>

<p>“We commence the class here in the open air of the Quidditch Pitch!” Hermione watches as several students scan their surroundings with eager anticipation. “Now, now, steady on, young rascals! Today, we shan't indulge in the sport of Quidditch, but rather the exhilarating venture of gnome foraging!” Several groans are issued from the cluster of students.</p>

<p>“Gnomes may be harmless creatures, however, they do prove to have a nasty bite, given the opportunity! Be cautious, as today you will gather the gnomes, sans wand! Only your bare hands will suffice! You will place them here, in your burlap sack.” He brandishes a jute sack and the dimensions cover his entire frame.</p>

<p>“Feel free to partner up! The entirety of the Hogwarts grounds is at your disposal, however, after you've collected your spoils, kindly return to the Quidditch Pitch and we shall proceed with our lessons! Now, come one, come all! Don't be shy, fetch a sack and a partner!”</p>

<p>Hermione surveys the crowd and her gaze lands on Malfoy, he is tugging at Theo, who is obviously struggling to break free. She continues her scan for a partner, and eyes Neville, who stands alone a few paces away.</p>

<p><i>Okay, no partner then.</i></p>

<p>Companionless, she joins the queue of students who wait for their sacks. Suddenly, there's a shove, and Theo's gangly form is wedged in beside her. An “Oi!”, most likely from Seamus, emanates from behind. She turns, to offer an apology, and is met with Malfoy's glare over Seamus's shoulder. Neville, wearing a melancholic expression, stands a few paces further behind. Quickly, she returns her attention to the front.</p>

<p>Theo bumps her shoulder, “Hey, you. A delightful day, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Hermione shoots him a sidelong glance, “Hi Theodore, are you particularly skilled in gnome foraging?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn't know, never seen one... Whole. Good ole' daddy-O kept a pack of Jarvey's around the grounds. He was particularly fond of observing their…trappings…”</p>

<p>“That's awful.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I've found from personal experience that stumbling upon dismembered limbs while gathering sticks can be rather traumatising for a youngster.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God. How old were you?”</p>

<p>“Six.”</p>

<p>Horrified and now positioned at the front of the queue, she retrieves a sack from the trunk and hands it to Theo.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we ought to make this a pleasant experience for you, partner.”</p>

<p>His grin is wide, “Please do.”</p>

<p>The pair venture off together and locate a thick hedge just outside the Quidditch Pitch. The sound of rustling from a large bush garners their attention. Hermione shoots Theo a look that communicates, “This one's yours”.</p>

<p>Brimming with excitement, he plunges into the hedge with gusto. The hedge trembles and shakes violently, and the foliage ripples in his fervent rummaging. Loud snaps of twigs and the crunching of leaves ensue. Theo's animated exclamations throughout the pursuit illustrate a vivid picture for Hermione's curiosity: there's a “Gaah!” And a, “You little…!” followed by a “Got you, tiny demon!”. Eventually, he emerges on all fours, clutching a gnome tightly in one hand, a victorious grin is plastered on his face.</p>

<p>“Hurry, grab the sack! Take the miniature devil! Shit, it tried to bite me!!”</p>

<p>Hermione fumbles in her attempt to open the sack, whilst Theo continues to wrestle the hostile gnome. It's especially plump around the waist and Hermione has to stretch the bag open widely for it to fit. On the way in, it's teeth latch onto her arm and she releases a sharp cry. Theo jumps to his feet and pinches the gnome's belly in an attempt to loosen its grip.</p>

<p>“Fuck! Let go, you deranged vermin!”</p>

<p>Finally, he tugs on the gnome's goatee and it releases her, she falls to the ground and scoots away. Holding the gnome upside down by the leg, avoiding it's gnashing and hissing, Theo shoves it into the sack, and quickly secures it shut. He gives it a fierce kick for good measure, then crouches down next to Hermione in the grass.</p>

<p>Taking her arm in hand he begins inspecting the open wound.</p>

<p>“Shit, are you okay Hermione?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yea…Do you— ah, fuck, do you know how to cast a healing charm?”</p>

<p>He nods, takes out his wand, and performs an Episkey. They both watch as the wound knits itself closed.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry, that was my fault. I should have..” His look of concern is poignant and Hermione feels the compulsion to send it back to the abyss from whence it came, and to never,—ever endure that look from him again.</p>

<p>“No, no! Theo— it's not your fault! I'm fine—It's all healed, just a little sore.” Her smile is weak, yet she hopes it eases his concern.</p>

<p>He seems to relax, his shoulders droop and he brushes his mousy hair from his eyes. Running his hand across his face, he lets out a heavy exhale. A few moments of silence pass, until suddenly, he brightens and rummages through the pockets of his robes, retrieving a vial containing blue liquid.</p>

<p>“It's a potion. I brewed it, it helps with pain and feeling... Well… better.”</p>

<p>Palming the vial, Hermione looks at him questioningly, his reply is a curt shrug and a devious smirk.</p>

<p>There he is.</p>

<p>Without further inquiry, she unstops the vial and downs the contents. The potion's journey down her throat produces a sting similar to liquor. Theo's smirk broadens into a grin. Once more, Theo digs through the pockets of his robes. He brandishes another vial of the same color, and swigs it. Exhausted, they both lie down amongst the vibrant grass. Then, Hermione's world tilts. Colors begin to dance across the sky languidly, laughter bubbles out from her lips.</p>

<p>“Oh, Merlin Theo. This— This is good. What have you been keeping from me?”</p>

<p>He turns his head to face her. When their eyes meet, they both erupt in laughter. Finally, Theo calms, and waves his hands in a dramatic flourish, “Yes, I'm a genius. How about I show you mine, and you show me yours?” She nods enthusiastically and the chuckling resumes.</p>

<p>They lie there, in ecstasy, far past the end of D.A.D.A. They ignore the chime of the Dinner bells and the setting of the Sun. Finally, in the dark of night, Hermione's bodily sensations return and she shivers from the crisp night air. Slowly, they peel themselves from the hard earth and walk haphazardly towards the castle. When they finally enter their house quarters, it is dark and silent. At the foot of the staircase to their separate dorms, Hermione reaches into her bag and pulls out her bottle of pills. She pours a few tablets into her hand and offers them to Theo.</p>

<p>“This helps with sleep… Among other things…Be careful.”</p>

<p>Outstretching her hand, Hermione drops a few pills into his palm. Theo stares down at them for a moment, nods, and pulls her into a tight embrace. At last, they depart their separate ways, each with bliss still thrumming through their veins.</p>

<hr>

<p>As dawn rises and peels back the curtain, Light performs her opening act. Time pauses with bated breath as Light executes an elegant arabesque and illuminates the skies, the world still paused, waits in anticipation. Finally, she hurtles across the Scottish Highlands in a magnificent Saut de Chat, the green hills erupt into the distance, and stretch on for eternity. The sky above, every blade of grass, and Draco release a shuddering exhale.</p>

<p>He shoots off, his chest flushed to the handle of his broom, as he races after her. She frolics and teases him as she prances across the ether in glittering rays. He dives, straightens, and whips across the countryside with calculated spirals — in his pursuit, dew and sweat amass on his neck and brow. Their dance is wild and controlled, peaceful and frenzied, both aware of this evanescent moment. When all darkness is finally exiled, light bounds heavenwards and finds her place with her master in the sky. Abandoned, Draco slows and collects himself with heaving breaths. For several moments, he looks on at the illuminated landscape, a soft breeze peels his damp hair off his forehead and to it, light places a gentle kiss. Finally, Draco pivots on his broom and departs.</p>

<p>Turning the handle to his room, the peace from his morning flight swiftly ceases when he is greeted by the sound of retching. In an instant, he is in the lavatory. Theo is leaning over the toilet, heaving.</p>

<p><i>Not again…</i></p>

<p>“Shit, Theo. Hold on.” Draco rushes to his trunk, yanks the lid open, and frantically rummages through it. His eyes finally catch sight of the red vial. He's only gone for a few moments, but when Draco returns, Theo now lies laterally across the tiles.</p>

<p>“Fuck.” Draco hoists him up into a sitting position against the wall.</p>

<p>“Theo! Open up, come on!” Theo's head lulls to the side, eyes moving to the back of his head. “Fuck!”</p>

<p>With his fingers, he manually pries Theo's mouth open, pours the contents in, and shuts it close. Theo begins coughing and spluttering, but Draco clasps his hand around his mouth to keep the contents in.</p>

<p>“Swallow Theo, come on! Fuck!” The spluttering continues for a few moments until finally Theo seems to take heed of Draco's request, and his throat visibly swallows. Finally, Draco unclasps his hand from Theo's mouth and moves to the wall next to his friend.</p>

<p>Ragged inhales and shaky exhales fill the room.</p>

<hr>

<p>“Hey..”</p>

<p>Hermione looks up to find Neville standing above her, his usual woeful expression on full display. Ginny, an obviously reluctant spectator, lingers behind him. Hermione fights a full-body squirm.</p>

<p>“Hi. What's this?”</p>

<p>Itching the back of his neck, he clears his throat.</p>

<p>”Erm, Just checking in, making sure you're alright.”</p>

<p>Hermione shoves her irritation down, down.“Why wouldn't it be?”</p>

<p>Neville's distress noticeably intensifies, he releases a loud exhale through his nose. Belatedly, she realizes the response was not well received.</p>

<p>"Well, you've been rather withdrawn. You never join us for meals, always rushing about and consistently late for classes now. And it seems you're avoiding me for some reason..."</p>

<p>Her mind sounds the alarm: Run, flee, hide!</p>

<p>“No, Neville... I'm sorry... I've been really busy lately... Please don't take it personally. It's only that it's been a hectic first week and all…”</p>

<p>His look of concern begins to dissipate, and he deflates slightly. "Yeah, I know this year has been tough for you. For everyone, really. Just please don't—don't shut us out, Hermione. We're a family, remember."</p>

<p><i>Family.</i></p>

<p>“Yea, yea, you're right. No, sorry, I'll be better Neville.” Hermione offers a small smile, albeit awkwardly.</p>

<p>He returns the smile broadly. "Great to hear it, Hermione. Well, I've got to go. I'm meeting Professor Sprout in the Forbidden Forest to forage for Bubotuber plants. Slughorn is running low on Bubotuber pus, so we've offered to collect some to replenish his stores.”</p>

<p>“Okay, Neville. Good luck.”</p>

<p>Neville beams, he pats Ginny on the back, gives her a pleased look, and departs toward the library exit. Ginny sinks into the chair across from Hermione and drops her head down onto the table, her mumbling into the mahogany wood is hardly audible, “Thanks for playing along.”</p>

<p>Hermione gives a small hum and eyes Ginny suspiciously. Sensing the glower directed her way, Ginny lifts her forehead from the table. A red blotch stretches from her hairline down to the top of her brow, she begins rubbing her eyes aggressively and lets out an exasperated groan.</p>

<p>“He's been attempting to approach you all week. He's adamant that you've been avoiding him, which is obviously true… I tried to get him to just leave off, but you know Neville, he's always fretting about one thing or another.”</p>

<p>Hermione rolls her eyes and returns her attention to her Arithmancy assignment, which is much, much, simpler.</p>

<p>“He tried to talk with me today, about Harry. All I could think about was how I wanted to slap that look off his face.”</p>

<p>Hermione drops her quill and grips her scalp, curls and all. “Aghh his eyes, Ginny! I can hardly bear to look at him anymore. That expression is always plastered on his face, you know the one—with the eyes, and the furrowed brow! I catch sight of it and all I want to do is throttle him!!” Her complaints rise in a passionate crescendo until a harsh “Shh” resonates from somewhere far away in the distance. Pince.</p>

<p>Ginny muffles a laugh into the crook of her arm, then recovers herself, “I know what you mean herms, just please, go easy on him, he's been exceptionally sensitive lately… I think he feels some kind of responsibility for keeping everyone together.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.. You're right I need to be more patient with him, he's been through a lot…” She clears her throat, "So, did you talk to him…? About Harry?</p>

<p>“No. There's not much to say, Hermione. He wants his space and I genuinely respect that decision, I've accepted it. There's not anything else to divulge.”</p>

<p>Ginny starts picking at her fingers where a reddened patch lines the side of her thumb. She's especially rough in an exposed area, and blood begins to trickle down the side of her thumb. Hermione wants to reach across the table and assure her that everything is fine; Harry is just confused, he's so afraid, he's lost everyone he'd ever loved. “He loves you, Gin.” Ginny looks up then and her eyes are glossy, “He's just— afraid.”</p>

<p>Ginny merely nods in response and returns her gaze to her fingers. They sit in silence for a few minutes. Finally, Ginny lets out a shaky exhale and looks back to Hermione. "So, it's Friday. What are your plans for the weekend? Fancy a trip to Hogsmeade?"</p>

<p>Hermione looks back down at her parchment, “I can't this weekend, I'm sorry. I— I have business…With the house and all…”</p>

<p>“I can go with you, you don't have to do it all alone. You have friends, that's what I'm for.”</p>

<p>“It's okay Gin, I need to do this alone. I want to do it alone.”</p>

<p><i>We all get through in our own ways, in our own time.</i></p>

<p>Ginny nods and doesn't pry. Instead, she shares a hug with Hermione, reassures her that she's here if she needs her, and moves to leave.</p>

<p>“Wait, Ginny?”</p>

<p>Ginny turns and cocks a brow.</p>

<p>“Is my spot,” Hermione gestures at the space around them, “Does this part of the library— does it seem moldy to you?”</p>

<p>Ginny gives an animated laugh and when she replies her back is turned and she's already strolling away, “Most definitely.”</p>

<p>Hermione scowls down at the paper in front of her. Malfoy, the tosser. She ruminates on their encounter earlier in the week, he's so fortunate not to be in Azkaban at the present moment, but he doesn't have an ounce of gratitude. He sulks and blames her—Her! Thinking of the imbecile makes her want to rip her hair out.</p>

<p>Malfoy and his sulking…</p>

<p>Neville and his worrying…</p>

<p>Ginny… Ginny and the lesions on her fingers…</p>

<p>Theo and potions…</p>

<p>Harry and nightmares…</p>

<p>Ron and drinking…</p>

<p>Herself and…</p>

<p>…Hermione and her pills.</p>

<hr>

<p>“And the more I drink, the more I feel it. That's why I drink too. I try to find sympathy and feeling in drink… I drink, so that I may suffer twice as much!”</p>

<p><i>-Crime and Punishment, Fyodor Dostoevsky</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Standing on the pavement, Hermione takes a small, shuddering breath. The familiarity and the strangeness, all at once, is heartbreaking. The house, with its charming stonework and lattice vines, fills her with a comfort only a place called home could truly provide. Home. The sight of it, once a source of solace, now gouges a hole through her heart. She approaches. In the wind, leaves swirl about, some crunch underfoot while others nudge her trainers in welcome.</p>

<p>She keys the lock and when the door swings open, the stale air hits her. Entering slowly, she scans the sitting room. The sofa and table, covered with dust, remain in their usual spots. Everything is in its place, and it feels so wrong. What was once a vibrant home, is now just an empty house. She pauses in front of a framed photo. Mom. Her Mother's eyes shine with warmth and one of her arms rests around empty air. Dad is smiling down at the space where her mother's arm rests.</p>

<p><i>Orphan.</i></p>

<p>Hermione is stone. Moments, minutes, hours, days, years, eons pass. She was forged in the beginning of time, birthed in the abyss, unearthed by jagged hands. She was formed by those same hands: molded, refined, sculpted. She was praised, glorified. The Storms and war weathered her. She deteriorated, decayed, and disintegrated to dust. Now she lives in the wind, never to be whole again.</p>

<p>Hermione leaves.</p>

<p>She gathers the post that has accumulated on the entrance floor and steps back out the door. With a final click of the lock, she turns and makes her way back down the brick path... A figure standing beyond the Pickett fence startles her. He's a lanky man, young looking, Hermione surmises, with jet black hair that falls heavily over his coal-lined eyes. He sports a leather jacket and is adorned with several pieces of jewelry: studded bracelets with spikes cover his wrists, hooped silver earrings line the side of his earlobes, and a chunky silver chain rests over his chest.</p>

<p>Hermione's hand moves toward the wand in her back pocket, “Um, Hello… How can I help you?”</p>

<p>“Hermione?” The voice is familiar, but Hermione can't place it.</p>

<p>“How do you know my name?” She's fighting the panic that is pounding in her ears telling her to RUN, RUN, RUN.</p>

<p>He seems to sense her anxiety and reaches his arms out placatingly, “Hey, Hermione. Cool down, it's just me, Jacob!” He pushes his hair from his forehead and Hermione immediately recognizes her childhood friend. “Oh my God! Jacob! Your hair! And what happened to your glasses?”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately runs over and pulls the boy she hasn't seen in ages into a tight hug. He returns the hug and when they pull apart they both examine each other. When they speak, it's simultaneously.</p>

<p>“How are you??” “How have you been?”</p>

<p>They both laugh and Jacob advances in his query “I haven't seen you in ages! Where have you been? How are you?”</p>

<p>“I've been… At school, in, erm— France.”</p>

<p>He looks at her, flabbergasted, “Wow Hermione, I knew you were bright back in the day but an international student, that's— that's great. It seems like France has treated you well…”</p>

<p>He grabs a curl, stretches it and when he lets go, there's an amused twinkle in his eye while he watches it spring back into place. Hermione swats at him playfully and looks up at his dimpled cheeks.</p>

<p>“How are you, Jacob? You must have graduated, what, two years ago now? Do you still live down the street?”</p>

<p>Still smiling and peering at her with awe, he shakes his head, “No, I moved out a few years ago. Just visiting and doing some business in the neighborhood. I actually live in the Old Smoke. I run a small, humble— nightclub.”</p>

<p>His grin morphs into a smirk. The incessant smiling and his flirtatious behavior confounds her, she blushes profusely.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow! That's pretty wicked, Jacob.”</p>

<p>He seems pleased by the praise and reaches into his back pocket, he pulls out his wallet and rifles through the cardholders. Hermione eyes a tiny plastic bag filled with white shiny powder wedged between a thick wad of banknotes. She swiftly deflects her gaze.</p>

<p>“Here we are,” he hands her a card with the name <i>The Velvet Flame.</i></p>

<p>“In case you ever find yourself in the city, looking for a familiar face. I live upstairs, just let the bouncer know you're looking to 'climb Jacob's ladder'.” Hermione stares down at the card, her face is set aflame. She gives him a sidelong glance.</p>

<p>“Real smooth Jacob, however, I will not be climbing any of your ladders.”</p>

<p>“Oh calm, Hermione. It's just a way I distinguish my true friends from those who pretend to be, just to skip the line. It's not meant to be taken literally, it's used commonly enough by my closest of friends.” With a final wink, he begins to back away.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I've got to run, it's almost six, and I have some last-minute preparations to see to before we open for the night. Maybe I'll see you soon?”</p>

<p>He continues backing away and she responds with a small nod. She mumbles, mostly to herself, “Yeah, Jacob, you just might.”</p>

            <h2>Tactics and Tension</h2>
            <div>
<p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>

<p>Despite the reality of whose fault it actually is, the apology spills from her lips, unbidden. Hermione silently chides herself for insinuating she's to blame, after all, it was the stranger who had crashed into her.</p>

<p>The encounter was akin to being struck by a train: there she was, minding her own business, as is decent—a habit all should practice—when suddenly a force barrelled into her, knocking her breath away, along with everything she had been carrying.</p>

<p>She peers down at the wreckage: books lie strewn across the floor whilst parchment flutters to the stone like feathers plucked from an unfortunate bird. Hermione quickly drops to the floor, determinedly ignoring the shooting pain as her knees collide with the unforgiving stone, and begins the hasty task of stacking books and corralling parchment. Whilst gathering papers by the dozens, she pauses, noticing the penmanship dancing across a page. The script, which slants slightly to the left, is neat with tidy pacing. The letters are pointed, deliberate, and intense. Never has she seen handwriting so organized, yet eloquent.</p>

<p><i>It's quite beautiful.</i></p>

<p>She feels the beginning of a blush creeping upon her cheeks when she realizes how close the parchment is held to her face--obviously ogling the contents, with the owner hovering close by no less. Admonishing herself for the intrusion of privacy, she resumes gathering the items.</p>

<p>When reaching to gather a scroll tied with a silver ribbon, her grasp coincides with- no, not paper...but soft skin. She stares down at the phantom-looking hand trapped under her own; at the long, pale fingers which radiate warmth under her touch.</p>

<p><i>A ghost?</i></p>

<p>She disregards the thought- surely Peeves and Nearly Headless Nick are substantially more translucent than this, and undoubtedly less warm.</p>

<p><i>Irrationally and seemingly plagued by insanity, she allows her thumb to graze across the backside of the palm and watches as the phantom fingers twitch in response.</i></p>

<p><i>Not a ghost.</i></p>

<p>Mortified, she peeks a glance at the stranger in front of her. Mere centimeters from her own, she finds two granite eyes with light-blue fissures coursing through them like glacial rivers.</p>

<p>“Boo.”</p>

<p>Hermione gasps, rears backward, and tumbles to the floor, landing painfully on her arse. The satchel in her arms falls with her, and some of its contents escape.</p>

<p>Hermione is not surprised when Malfoy ignores the commotion. Although, she does not miss the infinitesimal quirk of his upper lip, seemingly pleased with the reaction he was able to conjure. He moves to grab the remainder of his belongings from the floor, then straightens to his full height. Rooted to the stone, Hermione stares up at him on her elbows, flustered. He gives her a contemptuous look, as if she's something unpleasant he's found under his shoe, and raises an eyebrow. Hermione scowls.</p>

<p>“I ought to have known. Only a psychopath has penmanship like that.”</p>

<p>“That is quite hypocritical coming from the castle pedant.”</p>

<p>Hermione swiftly gathers her items, stuffing her journal and bottle of pills back into her satchel. She busies herself and makes a silent prayer that Malfoy has already gone. Please, Please, Please… Rising to her feet and brushing the hair from her eyes, she becomes aware of his lingering presence. Great. His gaze is scrutinizing, shrewd, and something else, curious? Despite it, she's left feeling uncomfortably exposed.</p>

<p>He nods toward her fastened satchel, “What is that?"</p>

<p>Hermione raises a brow. “What's what, Malfoy? My bag?”</p>

<p>He narrows his eyes, “What's in the bottle?”</p>

<p><i>The audacity.</i></p>

<p>She narrows her eyes in return. “Oh, it's something called, none of your damn business.”</p>

<p>“How intriguing, it appears you're carrying muggle medicine… Curiously enough, I recently stumbled upon a few muggle capsules littered across Theo's desk.”</p>

<p><i>Of course, he did. Oh, Theo, that slob.</i></p>

<p>She masks her culpability with a disapproving tut, “Sounds awfully like an admission, Malfoy. Were you slithering about, pilfering through my dear friend, Theodore's things?”</p>

<p>His eye twitches. A satisfying sense of triumph buoys her spirits, she stands a tad taller.</p>

<p>His renowned sneer makes an unfortunate appearance, “You're friend??”</p>

<p>Watching his indignation bloat and expand is thrilling. It's the risk, the danger that spurs her forward. She can't help it. Cannot help it. This is too good.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, yes.” She wrestles the grin that is trying to break free from her lips into a sly curve, “We're best friends, said so himself. He seems quite taken by me. It's almost as if, all this time he's been starved for companionship, and I couldn't help but wonder why. Then I realised, it's you. Being your friend must be like sitting in cold, wet darkness for ages, don't be peeved he's finally found the light.” The way his nostrils flare validates how good she is at getting under his skin and the power courses through her veins. Her Ego nudges her lips, just a little more, for effect, “In fact, I was just about to go meet with him, and you know, vow my fidelity and homage.”</p>

<p>If he caught her sarcasm, he certainly didn't acknowledge it. He swiftly moves, entering her space to loom over her. His frenzied state is equal parts terrifying in its intensity, and comical in its absurdity. Staring up at his pinched lips, and furrowed brow, Hermione fights her urge to burst into laughter.</p>

<p>He growls then, actually growls, “Granger, he's MY friend. MINE. Has been MY friend for years, will be MY friend for many more to come, long past the time that you will have grown tired of him.”</p>

<p>Hermione feels something deep within her snap. His twisted possessiveness ceases to be amusing; it's utterly repugnant. Somehow her previous proclamation of vowing fidelity and homage to her friend is the only thing at the forefront of her mind, and she allows her indignation to guide her.</p>

<p>“Yours? YOURS?? Is he your pet? Did you adopt him? Did you stroll to the pound, take a gander around, spot him wagging his tail about, and say 'Oh daddy, I want that one'? You're a little git, Malfoy, to think you can look at a person and say, 'that's mine'. Outrageous! You rapacious, egotistical, slimy snake! You have ME to contend with if you think you can go about claiming him as only yours!”</p>

<p>Malfoy clenches his jaw and flares his nostrils, seemingly attempting to master his rage. When he speaks, she's stunned by his authenticity.</p>

<p>“Theodore needs me. I can't—won't allow anything happen to him. He's…Salazar, why am I even explaining this to you?” He shakes his head ridding himself of all remaining human decency and stiffens like the callous wraith he is. When he continues, his eyes are distant and brutal, “Just leave him alone. You're wrong for him. Your trouble, I can sense these things. You're going to hurt him, perhaps you already have, and I… I'll be the one to have to pick up the pieces.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for her response, Malfoy shoulders his satchel and swiftly strides away. Alone in the empty corridor, Hermione who is heaving irate breaths, begins calculating his demise.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Draco is acutely aware that something needs to change. He needs to relax. The stress of being back at Hogwarts is pushing his agitation to levels reminiscent of sixth year, and it's only the middle of the second week.</p>

<p>The reality of being stuck sharing a common room with people who, only a few months ago, he had been forced to torture and ultimately battle, is overwhelming in itself. Add to that, his concerns about his mother, the frosty reception from his former friends, and the sight of his best friend cozying up to Granger, it's no wonder he's on edge.</p>

<p>Theo's overdose last week was the coup de grace. He can't concentrate, can't sleep. For Salazar's sake, he can't even seem to watch where he's going, proven by his collision with the bint, two days ago. She always has a way of rattling him, and since the encounter, he's been on the precipice of madness.</p>

<p>His mind drifts momentarily towards the fire whisky he has stashed in his trunk. No. He needs to stay focused on his courses, his studies, finishing the year, and getting out. Out!</p>

<p>And so, here he is, lugging a stack of books stacked so high, they reach his chin. Even with the aid of a shrinking charm, his bag is full to the brim, so he takes it upon himself to carry the rest. The balancing act makes it quite difficult to turn the nob and push open the door to his room, so he opts for entering backward.</p>

<p>Without warning, he's alerted to the sounds of giggling trickling from Theo's half of the room. He places the pile of books on his desk, strides to Theo's bed, and whips back the drapes.</p>

<p>Theo is sitting against his headboard, a hand over his mouth, laughter obviously trying to break free. Hermione Granger is stretched out like a cat at the foot of the bed, wearing her devious smirk. He knows that smirk, he knows this game. He knows her modus operandi: Get under his skin. He shoots a glance at Theo for letting the enemy in their room, in his space.</p>

<p>His words fight past his tightly shut jaw, “Theo, may I have a word?”</p>

<p>Hermione sits up and stretches her arms like the devilish cat she is. Her skirt rides up slightly in the process and Draco glances down at her exposed thigh. <i>Fucking hell.</i> From the corner of his eye, he notices Theo watching him…watch her. Draco immediately averts his gaze, opting to focus on the wall instead. Hermione eventually notices her raised skirt and hastily adjusts it before donning her robes. Snatching the remainder of her belongings from the side table, she turns her attention back to Theo, who is still lounging against the headboard.</p>

<p>“It's alright Theodore, I really must be off. There's a snug corner of the library calling my name.” Hermione shoots a brief glare at Draco before refocusing on Theo. "Thanks for the… delightful diversion," she adds with a playful wink. As the two's eyes meet, they share a rather exaggerated and slightly obnoxious giggle.</p>

<p>"See you at dinner?" Theo nods in agreement, and Hermione makes her way towards the door.</p>

<p>Draco, determined to win whatever twisted game this is, bends down to the floor and retrieves a pair of Theo's dirty socks. With the agility of a seasoned seeker, in which he is, chucks it at the back of her head. There's a resounding thud against her helmet of unruly hair.</p>

<p>She whips around, her brows knitted tightly in outrage. Oddly enough, tormenting the twit seems to alleviate some of his stress. Draco shucks that forbidden thought away, promptly and indefinitely.</p>

<p>“Keep your eyes about you Granger” He's aglow in his might. <i>Granger delenda est.</i></p>

<p>Her eyes are flaming, “One of these days Malfoy…You will get what's coming to you… You won't even know what hit you.”</p>

<p>And with that she strides across the threshold of the room, the door rattling shut in her wake.</p>

<p>“Wow, that was riveting. I'd be very worried if I were you...”</p>

<p>“She's nothing I have to worry about. What is Salazar's name was that?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh I don't know, Theodore.” He annunciates the name like she had, “She's a harpy, Theo, she'll dry out your bollocks, hang them by a string and use them to mark the musty pages of her books. Why are you faffing about with bloody Granger? She's a psycho, why would you let her in our room? Why was she here??”</p>

<p>Theo waves him off, ”She's my friend. I like her. Plus she's fun, more fun than you.”</p>

<p>“Swot and fun are not synonymous. In fact, they are incongruous. Granger is not fun.” He repeats the last sentence more for his own comfort.</p>

<p>Theo shrugs, “I like her.”</p>

<p>"Like her, like her?” Draco cringes at the thought.</p>

<p>Theo's nose crinkles and Draco is relieved to see it. “No, no. Not in that way, she's just— she understands, Draco.”</p>

<p>Draco looks down at the books he's brought from the library, carefully deliberating how to make his approach. He opts for veracity.</p>

<p>“Theo, we just have to get through the year… you should be focusing on your studies, not having 'fun' with Granger. Don't bring her back here. The mere sight of her is aggravating.”</p>

<p>Theo smirks devilishly, “Yes… It seems the sight of her does have quite the effect on you…”</p>

<p>Draco harrumphs, disregards his so-called 'friend', and turns back to his desk. He seats himself determinedly and surveys the mountain of books sprawled across the surface. He feels marginally less irritated than earlier and they don't appear as daunting. He doesn't dare question why that may be, but instead, with this newly found ease, takes one in hand and flips open the cover.</p>

            <h2>Resistentialism, A Case of: Part I</h2>
            <div>
<h3>July 1998, Two Months Prior</h3>

<p>“There is a letter for you.”</p>

<p>Draco reaches down, brushing the Floo dust from his trousers. When he finally looks up to his mother, he notices her outstretched hand offering an ivory letter. Not a second out of the hearth and here she is, obviously awaiting his return. How long has she been standing here, waiting? Draco's attention flickers to the letter, still hovering in midair by delicate fingers, and he notices the Hogwarts seal embossed on the back. His brow furrows and he eyes the letter apprehensively.</p>

<p>“What's this? I've already received my Hogwarts letter last week.”</p>

<p>Following the end of his trials, Draco received his letter from the headmaster herself. There was a boom of the gavel, and in a flurry of moments, Professor McGonagall had appeared in front of him, politely handing him an all too familiar envelope. His thumb had slowly brushed over the crimson Hogwarts seal, eyes flitting down to the four houses engraved into the parchment. She had made a sound, likely a cough, and Draco was brought from his stupor and focused on her stoic face.</p>

<p>“Hogwarts would be honored to have you return for your eighth year if you would accept.”</p>

<p>No mention of the fact that he was required to return, Ministry's orders. Despite her cordial disposition, Draco had intently read her pursed lips and shrewd eyes which had quietly relayed, “No, funny business this year, Mr. Malfoy.” Still reeling from the fact that he was, in essence, dismissed from all his war crimes, Draco had only nodded and swallowed the lump in his throat.</p>

<p>So why is his mother handing him a letter with the same seal? What if they had changed their minds? Maybe they've realized their mistake and no longer desire a death eater on the grounds…What if it's a letter of retraction? What would happen if he was unable to fulfill his probation requirement? Would he be sent to Azkaban?</p>

<p>Draco feels the familiar symptoms of panic rushing through his veins. He tries repeatedly to reinforce the walls of his occlumency which have momentarily faltered. But the pounding of his heart hammering through his chest, is loud and distracting. His posture gives none of this away, remaining the image of impassivity. But then the pinky on his right-hand twitches minutely.</p>

<p>His mother's eyes flit to his hand. <i>Shit, She's noticed.</i></p>

<p>“Draco…Darling…” Draco watches as his mother goes frigid and the color drains from her face.</p>

<p>Panic, the infectious worm has wiggled its way to her. He can see it crawling under her skin, ripping its way through her mind, boring into every crevice of her sanity. She takes a few heaving breaths, her chest sinking and collapsing with every exhale. She's so fragile like this, he can't stand it. In his desire to just have the moment end, he strides forward and takes the letter from her trembling grasp. Without hesitating he rips the seal and holds his breath in trepidation. His fingers fumble in parting the letter from its envelope. However, the damning words he expects—are not there...</p>

<p><i>Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy,</i></p>

<p><i>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is pleased to bestow the Portrait of former Headmaster and Professor, Severus Snape, into your custodianship.</i></p>

<p><i>Following careful consideration by the Hogwarts Board of Governors and the persistent petitions of the Portrait of Headmaster Severus Snape himself, it has been determined that the most suitable and dignified residence for the portrait would be under the care of his Godson, at Malfoy Manor. We kindly request your presence at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to collect the portrait at your earliest convenience. Until then, the portrait will be awaiting its departure under the care of Horace Slughorn. Thank you for your cooperation.</i></p>

<p><i>With Sincerest Gratitude,</i></p>

<p><i>Hogwarts Board of Governors</i></p>

<p>Draco stares down at the letter, completely dumbstruck. “It's—It's Professor Snape, he's…I am—The Hogwarts Board of Governors requests that I be the proprietor of his portrait.”</p>

<p>Narcissa releases a heavy breath and takes the letter. Her hand rests over her heart as she reads, humming in comprehension every so often.</p>

<p>“Oh. Yes—Yes. Well… we must accept. Severus, contrary to his behaviour, was never one for blatant ostentation. I doubt his portrait would revel in exhibition; I do believe he would prefer a significantly calmer and solitary environment. I think the south hall would do, there is the window that overlooks the gardens…”</p>

<p>“We will not accept.” The words are sharp and final.</p>

<p>His mother's eyes dart to Draco's own. “Draco… This is obviously a request by Severus himself.”</p>

<p>“No, It is the portrait's request, one I will not be fulfilling.”</p>

<p>She doesn't attempt to conceal her dismay. The way in which she stares into his eyes, searching, her forehead creased in concern, has Draco turning towards the window. He stares out at the setting sun, at the darkness vying for freedom within the shadows of the trees. He thinks, only a few more minutes and the dark will wreak its havoc. Draco tightens his jaw in newfound resolve.</p>

<p>“I was a pawn to him. He used me because he had to. He made a vow and he fulfilled his duties, nothing more. He never cared for any of us, Mother. We were left in the dark, forced to face the chaos due to the deliberate omission of his plans, his true allegiance… In the end, it was always Potter whom he was protecting, Not us. Not me, not father, not you…He could have saved us, he could have gotten us out. But he didn't. And so, we will not be accepting the portrait.”</p>

<p>Draco doesn't dare look at her face, he knows what he'll see and it will shatter his heart. Instead, he turns back around, heads toward the Floo, and grabs a handful of powder. He can see the figure of his mother in his periphery as he quietly mumbles "Nott Manor". When the flames rise to consume him, she finally disappears.</p>

<h3>Present Day</h3>

<p>There is a desk in the common room Draco has grown fond of. It's tucked away from the main footpath, yet still offers a view of the room's affairs. Draco feels it necessary to be aware of his surroundings at all times; awareness is survival. Plus, he likes to keep tabs on the people around him, despite not being fond of the half of them. They can be a source of entertainment, especially when one's assigned reading is particularly dull.</p>

<p>The Brown girl is seated at her usual sofa facing the large window; she's like a ghost, always wearing high-neck blouses, always sullen. Weasley sits with Longbottom at a table not too far behind Brown; the red she-weasel has been picking at her fingers for the last half hour. When Granger scurried past a few minutes ago, Neville put on the most aggravating face of concern. Draco can't stand to look at it, so he doesn't. His glance drifts to Blaise, who is sprawled on another sofa at the opposite end of the room to Brown's. His head is thrown back against the top of the couch, his mouth gaping open as he snores loudly. Pansy is curled up on the other end of the sofa, her onyx fringe covers her eyes. She writes aggressively in a journal, and ever so often she uses her sleeves to covertly wipe at her eyes.</p>

<p>Draco reorients his attention back to his current activities. Focus. Ruins. He reverts his gaze to his book. Then suddenly, a pair of shiny black loafers flit by in his periphery vision. Draco snaps his head up, “Where are you going?”</p>

<p>Theo hits himself in the face with the black journal he's carrying and groans, “Shit, thought you wouldn't notice me. I'm off to meet Hermione.”</p>

<p>“Granger, again? When are you coming back?”</p>

<p>Theo rolls his eyes, “You know, people are going to start to wonder why you're so obsessed with me and everything I do. Some might get the wrong idea."</p>

<p>“I'm not obsessed. It is not my fault that you require supervision. Look at what happened the last time you went out frolicking with her. I feel like a mother hen, minding a flightless chick who is prone to perils, such as leaping off dodgy ledges. It's exhausting. If my own mother wasn't so fond of you, I'd gladly turn my cheek and let you soar off any ledge to your heart's content.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dearest Narcissa. She does love me, doesn't she? How is she?”</p>

<p>Draco is not surprised that Theo can simply disregard ninety percent of what he has just said. He goes back to his reading, opting for ambiguity because, well, Merlin knows, conversation is a nonsensical undertaking.</p>

<p>“She's alright. Sends her regards.” He casually brandishes the envelope he received at breakfast. Draco refrains from disclosing that his mother is, in fact, not doing well. The parchment is strewn with her scribbles, parts of it indecipherable at times. He doesn't mention that her correspondence was solely related to flowers. Nor does he reveal that she repeated the same sentence twice in a row, then once more at the end of the letter: "The Begonias are blooming near your bench in the garden: be cautious, be cordial, do not make enemies.”</p>

<p>Theo regards Draco with an air of concern. "Draco, I understand you're stressed and tired. But if you could please try to tone it down a bit. I promise everything will be alright. Maybe you could try taking a walk every once in a while, or journaling; that might be helpful for your... stress."</p>

<p>Draco, unaccustomed to receiving such distasteful gestures of pity, seethes, "I could stop being stressed and tired if you'd deign to stop being such a nuisance! I'm stressed and tired because of your antics, Theo. I'm stressed and tired because you need to be surveilled regularly! I'm stressed and tired because you won't listen! I'M STRESSED AND TIRED BECAUSE I'M CONSTANTLY SAVING YOUR LIFE!"</p>

<p>The silence in the room is tangible. Draco looks around the common room and everyone's eyes are fixed on him and Theo. The sounds of shuffling papers fill the air as others grab their belongings and retreat to their rooms or out the door. Had he really been that loud? Had he yelled?</p>

<p>Draco winces at the thought and finally steals a glance at his friend. Theo is devoid of his usual exuberance and zest. Only a grave expression remains on his face, he lifts his chin and sniffs scornfully. "So be it Draco. The next time you find me, just let me die and then I will be out of your hair… And then, you can finally rest.”</p>

<p>When Theo leaves, Draco doesn't bother to glance around to see who's still watching. He fortifies his occlumency shields to a level he's rarely needed since facing Voldemort himself, and then, once safely behind the walls of his mind, he rages.</p>

<h3>“Hello, Goddess”</h3>

<p>Hermione lifts her head. Theo stands, clutching a battered-looking journal at the entrance to the alcove she's occupying. Two benches line either side of the small space and in between rests a window overlooking the Greenhouses. Theo settles himself on the bench opposite her own and grins widely in her direction. The flash of his teeth catches Hermione off guard and she spills her tea all over her white button-up.</p>

<p>“Theodore! Agh, my blouse! Why in heaven's name are your teeth… green?”</p>

<p>He ignores her statement entirely, “I think I'm in love…”</p>

<p>Hermione reddens and looks around awkwardly avoiding his gaze. If this plonker starts reciting a declaration of love…</p>

<p>Theo seems to understand his implications and rushes to correct himself.</p>

<p>"Not you! Hermione—I do love you, you know that… but only as a friend." The green of his teeth remains a looming presence, but the relief she finds in his words is of far greater impact.</p>

<p>Theo continues, “We'd never work, apologies love. You're far too wild and feisty, plus, too smart for your good! What you need in a lover is someone tenacious and clever.. someone, austere and watchful…”</p>

<p>Hermione breaks in, “Are you describing a lover or a prison guard?”</p>

<p>“.. Someone, draconian…” Theo blanches and his eyes go wide like he's discovered some kind of horrible error in the cosmos. Catching himself, he recovers quickly with an uneasy laugh, “Oh, ha! God that'd be awful…”</p>

<p>Hermione crinkles her nose in distaste, “I should have you scrub your mouth for saying that. I suppose that I should, as your teeth are green... You're one to call me wild, Theo you're nutters! You are the one going about terrorizing muggle pubs, calling people “Goddess”, whilst manipulating them into being your friend! In fact, you seem like you need someone ‘stoic and draconian' to watch over your barmy behavior.”</p>

<p>Theo scowls darkly and Hermione flinches, she didn't think Theo was capable of a scowl. He takes his wand and transforms his journal into a mirror, the scowl and darkness dissipates as he surveys the issue with his teeth.</p>

<p>He grumbles into the mirror, “I don't need watching… I have enough of that from the resident tyrant.”</p>

<p>Hermione is giddy to join in this degradation of Malfoy's character, “Yeah, what's his problem, Theo? He's such an arse, his contempt towards me has increased tenfold since befriending you. Like I had any choice in the matter! He acts as though you are some kind of mangy puppy he has to look after! He's obsessed!”</p>

<p>Theo, still scowling into the mirror, begins scraping at his teeth with his finger, “…I think he is…”</p>

<p>“… It's like he's in love with you!” Hermione pants.</p>

<p>Finally, Theo glances at her. Trouble and mischief dance in his eyes, “As a matter of fact...I think he is..”</p>

<p>Hermione stares at him blankly while he returns going about his business in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Oh Merlin, Theodore…” Her hands go to her chest “Draco's?…” her hand moves to cup her mouth “He's… I didn't know he was—not that I would judge him for it… but I've just never known he prefers…”</p>

<p>She removes her hand and clears her throat, “…So, he's in love with you?”</p>

<p>Theodore, a.k.a. Narcissus and his pond, the picture of nonchalance, nods into his reflection solemnly, “It really can be a curse…To be loved so fiercely.”</p>

<p>Hermione competes with the mirror to capture his gaze, “And you…?”</p>

<p>Theodore peeks a look at her from the corner of his eye, comprehending her suspicion, “NO! MERLIN—NO, NOT HIM!! It's… It's—Luna, Luna Lovegood.”</p>

<p>Hermione is taken aback, “Oh…” she blinks, then registers what he just said, “Hold on, what? Luna? How? And more importantly, why? I mean—she's lovely and all but…Luna, she's—well..” Hermione finally supplies with great insight, “She's Luna.”</p>

<p>Dearest Theodore is still scrubbing at his teeth in the mirror, he takes out his wand and performs a Scourgify, a Tergeo, and tries several other incantations.</p>

<p>“Agh! Nothing's working! And I still have that blasted taste in my mouth!” He smacks his lips together, tasting. “Copper.. and… onions... Bleck. Luna may be wonderful but Gurdyroot is abominable.”</p>

<p>Hermione gapes in horror, “You tasted it?!”</p>

<p>“Well yeah, she was staring at me with those angelic, alluring, oversized eyes, behind the goggles, of course, so I had to! She just watched as I took a sip, and her eyes would not relent! So I began drinking it. Her gaze—I was entranced, Hermione! I began quaffing it in earnest, she finally dropped the spell when it was gone. Merlin, I was heaving by the end of it, I almost retched all over her Mary Jane's!”</p>

<p>“You drank it ALL??”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was horrid. Worst decision of my life, but somehow also the best! Her reaction, Hermione—her smile was resplendent! She said the mole on my neck means I'm honorable! She thinks I'm honorable! No one has ever said that to me. I think—I think I may be in love.”</p>

<p>“In love—with LUNA of all people? I can't process this, I might need some of that potion, Theodore.”</p>

<p>“Well… that brings me to my original reason for seeking you out. I need to brew again… I have most of the ingredients already, but I'm just missing a wee bit of Wormwood.”</p>

<p>Hermione ponders this. Wormwood...commonly used for Euphoria Elixir... “Is that what it is, Euphoria Elixir?”</p>

<p>Theo hums in delight, "I knew you were as smart as they say, Hermione. It's not exactly that, but very similar. The potion's base is Euphoria Elixir, but it has some personalized tweaks... a combination of ingredients related to calming draught, among others… However, I've run out of my supply of wormwood, we only need a few drops of the essence..."</p>

<p>“Wormwood essence?? Theo, that's not something that we can easily come by.”</p>

<p>His glance jumps to the window at the greenhouses below, “We can try sprout.”</p>

<p>Hermione huffs, “That's ridiculous. She may have the plants, but extracting the essence is time-consuming and requires several fully-grown plants. It's not exactly harvesting season and Sprout will most definitely notice if half of her supply goes missing.”</p>

<p>Theo contemplates this, “What about Slughorn?”</p>

<p>Hermione lowers her voice to a whisper, “You mean to nick Wormwood essence from Slughorn's potion cabinet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, precisely.” He grins, “I know there is a bottle of it in there, I've seen it. He won't even notice.”</p>

<p>Hermione contemplates this. If they were to just slip in, snatch a few drops… They'd be in and out in an instant... There's really no consequence to the matter. Slughorn wouldn't know the difference.</p>

<p>She sighs in acquiescence, “Alright, Theodore, I'm trusting you. We will be in and out, no complications.”</p>

<p>Theo's teeth perpetually green, are brandished atrociously in an open grin, “Yes It'll be simple, and trust me, no funny business on my part.”</p>

<p>Hermione stands, reluctantly succumbing to the scheme. "Alright then, lead the way..."</p>

            <div>
            <h2>Resistentialism, A Case of: Part II</h2>
            <p>Hermione finds the title 'Potion's Room Extended Cabinet' inadequate for the necropolis she currently finds herself standing in. The space is cluttered with rusty cauldrons, quite likely from the bowels of the dark ages, ranging in sizes small enough for Hermione to hold in her palm and large enough to rival the size of hot tubs. Ominous-looking Stirring sticks of like-wise varieties are stuffed in jars and pitchers that border a slender and jagged footpath, similar to flowers that line a garden promenade. Hermione reflexively tugs Theodore's collar, yanking him towards her, narrowly preventing his distracted face from colliding with a stirring stick the size of a canoe paddle. Theo staggers inelegantly, his polished loafers scuffing the stone floor until finally he straightens and tidies his robes.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione continues scanning the space. Carved into the walls are shelves bearing every ingredient a Potioneer could dream of. Dusty and cobweb-covered, vials, and jars stretch from floor to ceiling, and the extent of the cache seems to stretch on endlessly down a dimly lit hallway.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione is affronted. “Hogwarts does not have endless resources, my arse! This place is chock-full of ingredients! Slughorn, that greedy snake!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore, already rummaging through a stockpile of jars, turns to face her, “See, as I said, he won't even notice.”</p>
        
        <p>He resumes his perusal of the shelves and Hermione joins, all previously held shame whisked out the window. Fueled by her disgust, she nicks a few items from a nearby shelf and roughly shoves them into her beaded bag.</p>
        
        <p>Theo twists his head over his shoulder and regards her with raised brows. “Come now, don't be greedy.”</p>
        
        <p>“Slughorn does not need that amount of powdered moonstone or dittany; they do go rancid after a time… Besides, proper experimentation does require an array of materials.” She shoots him a mischievous wink and pivots back to the shelves.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, Theo! Look here!” Theodore, who stands on the other side of the room, presently wedged between two massive cauldrons, swivels precariously on his heel to face her.</p>
        
        <p>“It's a vial of Twinkling Teeth! It should help rid the green!” Unthinking, she tosses the bottle toward him and watches it arc across the room. Theodore's long, lanky arms shoot up in a miserable attempt to snag the vial. Wedged immovably between two cauldrons, the result is a flurry of flailing limbs which cause his fringe to flop over his eyes, effectively obscuring his view.</p>
        
        <p>Briefly, Hermione's mind flashes to the memory of attending an art exposition with her parents, wherein the performers donned long hair that had masked their faces entirely. Without the accompaniment of music, they began to dance about in a frenzy of abstract movements made entirely of limbs and torsos. Hermione is helpless to ignore the thought that, Theodore Nott would do exceptionally well as an interpretive dancer. She breaks from her stupor when she realizes the vial's trajectory is directly aimed at his face, he's still oblivious to this fact, and this time, she is too far to intervene. “Oh, dear… Theo watch out!”</p>
        
        <p>It's too late, the vial has already met its target—his left eye. “AHHGG!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore clasps his hand over his eye. The bottle, which had bounced off said eye, locates its new trajectory, the stone floor. It shatters.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh Fuck, Theo, I'm so sorry!”</p>
        
        <p>“Why did you throw it at my eye??”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione gasps in indignation, “Theodore, I did not aim for your eye! I thought you'd catch it!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo still holding his hand to his eye grumbles angrily, “I apologize that my reflexes are not on par with your superior athleticism!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione huffs, “Theodore, I have never in my life been described as athletic—to any degree. Though… I suppose a year of living out of a tent and being hunted and tortured by a megalomaniac would add agility to one's skillset.”</p>
        
        <p>“In future instances, I implore you to designate activities requiring such agility to some other unfortunate friend. I have seen quite enough.” He emphasizes this by lifting his hand from his eye. It already appears to be swelling; dark discolorations beginning to form over the lid.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione takes another vial of Twinkling Teeth off the shelf and shuffles her way across the room towards him. His head is tipped back to the ceiling while he taps at his eye, wincing every few moments. When she reaches him, she receives an up-close view of the monstrosity before her. Theodore's left eye is bloodshot and watering profusely. The lid is puffed up, limiting his mobility to a state of half-liddedness. A spider web of veins crisscross over it in a shade of green that rivals his stained teeth. He looks at her, and a tear parts from his grotesque eye.</p>
        
        <p>“How—How, does it look?”</p>
        
        <p>Staring into it, Hermione feels her own eyes begin to water from the sight. She averts her gaze, reaching into her beaded bag to retrieve the dittany she had pilfered, then silently conjures bandages and a clean cloth. Seating him on a nearby trunk, she makes quick work of applying the dittany and wrapping the bandage around his head.</p>
        
        <p>“All will be well soon, no need to worry.” Theo only nods in response. Hermione hands him the bottle of Twinkling Teeth and he accepts without protest, downing it in a single swig. He bears his teeth to her, “Is the green gone?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione stares at his teeth, no longer green, but white. A blinding, brilliant white, like staring at the sun through a mirror. She stutters an appeasing, “Yes—Erm—Definitely no longer, green.” Then, smiling awkwardly, turns away, “Alright. Now that, that— is settled, let's get back to our search.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo groans and shifts back to an upright position and resumes his scouring of the shelves. Hermione decides to continue her search where she had begun. She tiptoes back to her place, dodging the large cauldrons, broken glass, and an array of open trunks and boxes filled with various contents. Unaware of a coverlet strewn haphazardly across the walkway, with one end draped over a wooden box, she trips. Her stumble propels her into a nearby large shelf, causing the glass jars and vials to jostle and clatter.</p>
        
        <p>“Shite!” Incensed, she picks up the quilted cover with the goal of hurling it back at the box. However, when she draws back her arm to enact the blow, she stills, all the color drains from her face.</p>
        
        <p>Gazing into the box, her eyes meet the familiar glare of Professor Severus Snape. She releases a startled gasp.</p>
        
        <p>On the other end of the room, Theo whirls around and takes a stance like a startled deer ready for flight. His one eye shooting about in every direction, “What is it??"</p>
        
        <p>Her heart is thumping loudly in her chest when she finally meets Theo's good eye.</p>
        
        <p>“Why is Professor Snape's portrait in a box in the potion's cabinet?”</p>
        
        <p>His single eye blinks and he relaxes, “How should I know?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione lowers onto her haunches and leans down to the painting.</p>
        
        <p>“Hello… Erm—Professor Snape who did this to you?”</p>
        
        <p>His answering snarl has Hermione pulling back slightly.</p>
        
        <p>“You fool, I requested it! All that I have ever desired was complete, uninterrupted solitude. It appears that even in death, I cannot be afforded such luxuries!” His sneer is mighty. Hermione can't seem to control her psychosomatic response of flinching, and bizarrely awaiting the removal of house points.</p>
        
        <p>Her anxiety gives way to pity when she realises he is only a portrait and his powers are limited. “Professor, you cannot exist out of a box—in a creepy and abandoned potion's cabinet!”</p>
        
        <p>“I have never been in better company.”</p>
        
        <p>Suddenly, the sound of distant voices emanate from outside the potions classroom. Hermione looks to Theo, who has paused in his inspection, they both share the same look communicating, “Time to leave”.</p>
        
        <p>Theo urgently whisper-yells from his station across the room, “How about the wormwood essence? We can't just leave without it!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione frantically surveys her surroundings, when all of a sudden, a light switch in the back of her mind flicks on. “Accio Wormwood essence!”</p>
        
        <p>Instantly, eight bottles come hurtling towards her from various directions. She manages to catch four, while two collide with the shelf behind her, and the remaining two careen past her, striking Theo in the head and abdomen, respectively. He lets out another yelp and Hermione finds herself growing tired of his noisy complaints, “Oh hush! You'll have us caught!”</p>
        
        <p>Professor Snape releases a sigh of relief, “I take it you will finally indulge my wishes and obligingly— shove-off?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione scrutinizes the crate in which Professor Snape's portrait is stored. She makes a wild decision, on par with flying a dragon out of Gringott's.</p>
        
        <p>“I'll hear none of it professor, We're getting you out of here.” She turns to Theo and nods at the box in a firm order, “Theo hurry, take the other end!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione quickly heaves up half of the box while Theo ungracefully shuffles to the other end without objection. Snape objects loudly, “What! NO!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo's mummified head gestures down to the box in his arms and his single eye meets her own, “Where are we taking him?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione ponders this. “Erm— well, that is a good question. I'm afraid that I'm not too sure as of yet… I suppose we could leave him at Hagrid's— for the time being… Until I can have it properly sorted…”</p>
        
        <p>Snape erupts in a fit of wrath, his protests reverberate through the silence. “NO! NO! NO!”</p>
        
        <p>The noises from beyond the door go silent, then a voice asks, “Did you hear that?”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione gestures with her nose to the quilt on the floor and whispers to her friend, “Theo I'll hold it, get the cover back on, he doesn't know what's good for him.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo obliges and retrieves the cover from the floor, draping it over the box. Muffled cries sound from beneath. “Cast a muffliato!” Theo minds her orders and finally, silence resumes.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione makes her way to the potions cabinet exit, “There's a staircase— a hidden passage. It's Behind Slughorn's desk, hurry!”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore, an ever-appeasing accomplice, follows her lead as they sidestep out of the cabinet, across the potions classroom, and to the door behind Slughorn's desk. With a wandless Alohomora, she unlocks it effortlessly, earning an impressed quirk of Theo's only visible brow.</p>
        
        <p>They step into a dimly lit stairwell, its steps winding into darkness. Behind them, the door slams shut with a resounding boom, causing the walls to tremble. Dust and debris fill the air, leaving both Hermione and Theo coughing through the clouds of it. When they recover, and the dust clears, they stand there, at the foot of the stairs, peering upward into the doom beyond.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione can't help but feel like Frodo, with her own loyal — albeit slightly mangled— Sam at her side, embarking on the Pass of Cirith Ungol, bearing the weight of… Hermione stops herself. There is no way she will be equating Professor Severus Snape's Portrait to ‘The One Ring to Rule Them All'.</p>
        
        <p>They commence their ascent up the spiral stairs. For countless moments, their ragged breaths are the only sounds echoing through the tower. It's pitch black and the combination of the weight of the box and the difficult uphill climb has Hermione collapsing against the stone wall.</p>
        
        <p>“We need to stop a moment, It's so dark. I can't see a thing!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione heaves a few breaths against the stone when she begins to feel the sensation of something crawling on her shoulder. She screams, dropping the box. It tumbles a few steps before Theo readjusts his hold. When he opens his mouth to ask what happened, a blinding light beams forth. And in the brilliant illumination, hundreds upon thousands of spiders on the walls, floor, and ceiling, shrink back into their crevices. All Hermione's brain can register is that Theo's teeth are most definitely The Phial of Galadriel.</p>
        
        <p>“Theo, your teeth! Keep your mouth open! It's the Twinkling Teeth, you can light the way!”</p>
        
        <p>Eager to oblige and get the hell out, Theo continues bearing his teeth effectively lighting up the stairwell.</p>
        
        <p>After what seems like a hundred steps Theo finally moans, “How… many… bloody…steps… are there??”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione bites her lip, “Well, we were in the dungeons… This tower is similar to the one near the divinations class, so the first exit should be on the sixth floor.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo releases an exasperated sound and begins muttering under his breath about “damn staircases”, his “bloody eye” and the like. Hermione's legs are shaking from the ascent until finally, they reach the sixth floor. They both fling themselves out of the dusty staircase with heaving breaths.</p>
        
        <p>Hermione groans, “Never… climbing a staircase…ever…. Again”</p>
        
        <p>Theo drops to the floor and rests his back against the wall, reaches into his robes, and takes out a blue vial, “Here, we can share.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo hands the vial to Hermione and she takes a place next to him against the wall. Unstopping the vial, she takes a few sips and when she is feels sated, hands the rest off to Theo. Immediately the effects begin working. Hermione notices the intensity isn't as overpowering as it was the last time she took it, most likely due to the smaller dosage, but the bubbling laughter is still prominent.</p>
        
        <p>In her haze, she has a fuzzy realisation, “Theo, we didn't use a featherlight charm.”</p>
        
        <p>Theo raises his fists to the heavens and begins pumping ferociously, “GAAAHH!”</p>
        
        <p>The eruption climbs up her throat, collecting behind her closed lips, until finally it pops. Spittle and peels of mirth bound from her lips and all over the side of Theo's unbandaged face. There are a few moments when he just stares at her in shock. Hermione's mortification rises to her cheeks and she can feel them staining red. Finally, he ends the stiff silence and bursts into manic laughter. He descends to the floor, falling onto his side, and clutches at his stomach, heaving and choking on air, all while rays of light burst forth. It is all just so ridiculous, preposterous, and contagious. Tears fall from Hermione's eyes from the gaiety of the moment, and also from re-discovering the joy she thought her shriveled heart would never again experience. Theo; the nearly blind, havoc-creating, luminescent wizard, is the best thing that has happened to her in a very long time. In this moment, she has a sudden realization: for her friend, Theodore, she would gladly ascend every staircase in Hogwarts, and would certainly scale Mordor's loftiest peak. The following few moments are spent in euphoric delight before they simultaneously decide, “Onward!”</p>
        
        <p>Sharing the weight of the box between them, Hermione and Theo snake down the corridor in erratic steps, winding to the left, then to the far right. On their unsteady course, Theo trips over his lanky legs and collides with a pillar. The crate slips from their combined grasp and sends Professor Snape's portrait skidding across the floor until it finally comes to rest, face-down on the stone. There are muffled shouts and Hermione, tearful from laughter, peels the portrait from the floor on unsteady feet.</p>
        
        <p>“You blithering idiots! Put me back!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione leans down on her haunches and begins attempting to soothe the portrait, “Sorry professor, please quiet down. I promise to take you back out when we get to Hagrid's! I'll even hang you on the wall! I'm sure Hagrid would love the company….” A flurry of “NO's” erupt forth. She re-directs her attention back to Theo, hastily gesturing to him, “Theo! Hurry! Place the cover back on, shut him up, please.”</p>
        
        <p>“SHUT ME UP?? YOU DAFT, IMPUDENT, CRETIN, I WILL HAVE YOU BY THE —.”</p>
        
        <p>Snape is quickly shut up when Theo drops the cover back into place.</p>
        
        <p>“Thank Merlin! Come on, let's go…. I believe we're somewhere near the Divination tower, it should be one floor above… I think if we head straight down this corridor it should take us to the staircase and we can make our way to the —."</p>
        
        <p>Hermione stops in her tracks. At the other end of the hall, approaching swiftly is Professor Slughorn. She swallows. Theo, the merry deformed-looking fool, leans down to her ear and whispers placidly, “It's alright, he won't notice.”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione peeks a glance down the hall at the approaching professor and then at the box in their shared arms. Written on the side facing Slughorn are the words:</p>
        
        <p><i>Property of Horace Slughorn</i></p>
        <p><i>Do Not Remove From Potion's Cabinet</i></p>
        
        <p>Hermione blanches, “OH GOD, THEO!” With a violent shove the crate is out of her arms and into Theo's, “Hurry get rid of it!! I'll distract him!” She dashes toward Professor Slughorn in several movements made of skips, hops, and a brisk jog. Slughorn is not prepared for the onslaught when she finally greets him.</p>
        
        <p>“Professor! Lovely day, wouldn't you agree?…” She smiles up at the plump, red-cheeked man.</p>
        
        <p>Professor Slughorn greets her with merriment, “Oh! What a pleasant surprise! Ms. Granger, what brings you to the sixth floor?”</p>
        
        <p>“Oh erm…” she searches frantically for a viable excuse, “The—the statues! Yes! The statues on this floor are quite fascinating, here take a look!” She shoves Professor Slughorn in the direction of a disheveled knight who leans aslant against a stone pillar. Dust and cobwebs litter its lacklustre surface.</p>
        
        <p>“Here, Professor. You must take a gander at the details! It is so— stimulating! The artistry and…. the details… Yes! Quite riveting, wouldn't you agree?!”</p>
        
        <p>She manhandles him roughly, jostling him every few seconds, forcing him to survey the knight from a new and exciting angle. His potbelly stomach brushes against the figurine, transferring a streak of ancient dust onto his waistcoat. To her relief, he takes the bait, leaning in closely to inspect the dilapidated armour.</p>
        
        <p>“Quite right, Ms. Granger! Fine craftsmanship it is! I'd go on to say there is nary a rival amongst its kind! A keen eye, Ms. Granger!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione takes a peek back at Theo, who now, to her consolation, is noticeably box-less. Thank heavens! Slughorn is still examining the figure when Hermione quickly plans her escape.</p>
        
        <p>“Oh, Professor! I really must be on my way. It was lovely speaking with you!” She rounds in a 365-degree turn and briskly walks away. In her departure, she hears the professor hum another, “Indeed!”</p>
        
        <p>Returning to Theo, she grabs him by the elbow and heaves a sigh of relief, “Well, that was—close… Too close… Where's the box?”</p>
        
        <p>Theodore's expression is blank. “What box?”</p>
        
        <p>Simultaneously, the potion's effects wane, whilst her agitation rises. “Theodore…The box containing our former professor's sentient portrait, where is it?”</p>
        
        <p>He supplies a curt laugh, “Oh, ha! Yes, that one…Ha well..” His voice lowers to a quiet mumble, “ithrewta wenoh”</p>
        
        <p>“Theo what are you saying I can't understand your mumbling”</p>
        
        <p>Theo opens his mouth to repeat himself just as a piercing cry pierces the air. Frantic pleas for help ensue, it appears to be coming from outside. Hermione rushes toward the window and gasps at the scene below. On the top of the hillside below Padma or… Pavarti?— Some Patil or another, leans over a prone body, shrieking—Definitely Pavarti. A wooden box, seemingly empty and on its side lies a few feet away. Several floors below a dark, thick garment hangs listlessly on a gargoyle. Hermione's heart seizes. Pavarti shifts, revealing a motionless body on the ground, and Bloody shite of all holy hell… The pale form of Draco Malfoy lies prone in the grass. Theo finally dares to join her, and peers out of the window toward the havoc below.</p>
        
        <p>He gasps. “Oh, fuck. I'm dead!”</p>
        
        <p>“You're dead??? He looks like the dead one Theo!”</p>
        
        <p>“FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!” He begins ripping into his hair, pulling the strands maniacally, the action unfurling the bandage covering his eye.</p>
        
        <p>“You killed your best friend!” Hermione pales, turns to face him, and cups her mouth.</p>
        
        <p>“OH, GOD THEO… YOUR LOVER!”</p>
        
        <p>Theo looks like he's been struck, one eye is wide in terror while the other is glued shut from the swelling, “He's not my lover you twat! He loves me, it's not reciprocal! FUUCK!”</p>
        
        <p>Hermione scrubs at her face, “Merlin, that's even worse!”</p>
        
        <p>One eye is a saucer, “What have I done!?”</p>
        
        <h2>ATTEMPTED MURDER OF EX-DEATH EATER DRACO MALFOY AT HOGWARTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY</h2>
        <h3>By Rita Skeeter</h3>
        
        <p>Former Death Eater, Draco Malfoy, the prized fledgling of He-Who-Must-not-Be-Named; Pawn in the meticulously plotted murder of Albus Dumbledore; The Slytherin Prince, was found unconscious in a presumed case of attempted murder at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, on the evening of September 15th, 1998.</p>
        
        <p>Evidence surrounding the crime scene suggests he was brutally attacked by the portrait of former headmaster and long-time potions professor, Severus Snape.</p>
        
        <p>The portrait had reportedly struck the head of the ex-death eater Draco Malfoy with considerable force, leaving the victim in a state of comatose, before tumbling down an embankment and into the black lake. Several hours later it was retrieved from the depths by Aurors when numerous students residing in the dungeons had reported seeing the portrait being inappropriately handled by the lake's resident selkies. A witness, fourth-year Slytherin, Rory McFarland, recounts his story of the event:</p>
        
        <p>“There I was, minding my ain business, finishing aff the last o' the liquorice Wands my gran had sent me, when I glanced out the windae and saw somethin' that fair took my breath away! Headmaster Severus Snape was in a right peculiar position, never seen such angles and pasitions, he was being forced tae—.”</p>
        
        <p>The Graphic details of the incident have been determined unsuitable for general audiences. If you'd like the full account please turn to page 7 and remove enchantments on the page…</p>
        
        <p>News of this incident emerges mere months after Draco Malfoy purportedly refused the custodianship of the portrait. An anonymous source, with ties to the inner circles within Hogwarts, confirms that the portrait had been offered to the Malfoy's by the Hogwarts Board of Governors in response to the portrait's specific request to reside at Malfoy Manor. It was public knowledge that the deceased, Severus Snape, was Godfather and mentor to Draco Malfoy. Some question the possibility of unresolved animosity between the two.</p>
        
        <p>Why would Draco Malfoy refuse care of his former Godfather's portrait? Were hatchets not buried with the former Headmaster? The speculations of retributive justice by the portrait itself have been called into question.</p>
        
        <p>The head Curator for the Restoration and Maintenance of Magical Art and Relics at the Ministry of Magic accounts the probability of such an incident:</p>
        
        <p>“It is very unlikely that an enchanted portrait would aspire to machinations such as devising and attempting murder. Even less likely is that such an ambition be fueled on the grounds of vengeance. The success of such a scheme would likely require the assistance of a witch or wizard as an accessory. It is not in a portrait's nature to manipulate witches and wizards to do their bidding, except in cases of extreme threat to the portrait's livelihood or if such impulses were ‘written into' the painting, by the artist.”</p>
        
        <p>It begs the question of exactly who was involved in the schemes of Portrait Severus Snape. What were his motives? Who was an accomplice?</p>
        
        <p>The portrait of Severus Snape is currently undergoing a restorative process after spending several hours at the bottom of the Black Lake, deeming it unavailable for questioning. However, an eyewitness, Pavarti Patil, currently a student at Hogwarts and a former member of the student-led militia group Dumbledore's Army, shares her account of the events:</p>
        
        <p>“It was dreadful! I was on my evening stroll, when all of a sudden, something came hurtling out of the sky. I tried to warn him! I told him to look out, but he only sneered at me like I had gone mad! The next moment, the corner of the frame struck Malfoy atop the head and all I could see was the scowling bust of Professor Snape flying past. The portrait ricocheted off Malfoy's head, sped down the steep hill, and splashed into the dark lake. It happened so fast! By the time I looked back, Malfoy was lying on the grass, unconscious. I was in shock! All I could manage to do was to scream, and that's precisely what I did.”</p>
        
        <p>As we await the Auror's investigation to uncover the truth behind what really transpired, we're left with some questions of our own...</p>
        
        <p>Who conspired with the Portrait of Severus Snape to attack Ex-Death Eater Draco Malfoy?</p>
        
        <p>What tensions simmer between Draco Malfoy and his peers?</p>
        
        <p>Who would want Draco Malfoy dead?</p>

            <h2>Ligatus</h2>
            <div>
<p>“Hi. Erm— I'm Junior Auror, Harry Potter.”</p>

<p>Harry lifts his hand to the crowd in a hesitant wave. The throng of gathered students comprised of prefects and the entire house of Phoenix stare unimpressed at their former classmate aka, the Hero of the Wizarding World. Shuffling on his feet nervously, Harry focuses his attention down to his parchment, clears his throat and begins reading softly, word for word.</p>

<p>“I am here of behalf of the Ministry for Magic, with the investigation of the case regarding a recent attack—.”</p>

<p>There's a shout from somewhere in the crowd. “Speak up! We can't hear you!”</p>

<p>A red blotch appears on Harry's neck and blooms upward. He nervously reaches his hand up to scratch at his head, when he removes it, a portion of hair stands on end. Hermione finds herself fighting the overwhelming impulse to rush the platform and flatten it back into submission. Harry has never been one for elaborate speeches or ornate diatribes, he's a man born of action. His life has been formed by what he does, rather than says. One does not kill a Basilisk, fight off a hoard of dementors, or defeat the Wizarding world's most infamous dark lord by words alone. Hermione pity's him, the entire affair must be agonizing.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry.” Harry retrieves his wand from his robes, and with trembling hands, holds it to his neck, casting a shaky amplifying charm. When he clears his throat, the sound thunders through the room.</p>

<p>“THE INVESTIGATION IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the gathered crowd instinctively clutch their ears, protecting themselves from the onslaught of noise.</p>

<p>Ginny breaks in and bellows over the clamor. “TOO LOUD YOU MUPPET!”</p>

<p>For several moments, Harry only blinks at Ginny, a mortified expression is plastered across his face. Hermione finally takes pity on her friend and climbs the platform. She helps him to adjust the volume on his charm, pats his hair back into a respectable shape, and retreats back to her place among the horde. Harry gives her a nod of thanks and turns back to address the crowd.</p>

<p>“I apologize for the interruptions. Erm— I'll just go ahead and begin again.” He clears his throat and reattempts his speech.</p>

<p>“I am here on behalf of the Ministry for Magic to investigate the recent attack of a Hogwarts student. The investigation is currently underway. It has been made my job to investigate the possible perpetrator behind the attack. Investigations can last several weeks, and currently, it is not known how long this particular investigation will last... I will be investigating possible suspects by speaking to those close to the victim in order to solve the—Erm— investigation…”</p>

<p>Dean and Seamus, to Hermione's immediate right, rudely and indescreetly have their attention focused at the floor. Hermione's of the sense to knock them upside the head and make them pay attention, when she notices their shoulder's shaking; looking closer she realizes it's an obviously feeble attempt at controlling their laughter. From within the crowd, a hand shoots up. Hermione peers around the heads of several onlookers and connects the owner of said hand to be Blaise Zabini.</p>

<p>“Pardon, my apologies. I am having some difficulties wrapping my head around this. What exactly are you here to do?”</p>

<p>Harry blinks. “I'm here to investigate.”</p>

<p>Hermione peeks a glance at Dean and Seamus again, who seem to have entirely abandoned the activity of breathing, their faces flushed scarlet.</p>

<p>Zabini nods, rubs at his chin, and hums in thought. When Harry opens his mouth to continue his speech, Zabini interrupts again, raising a finger in another query.</p>

<p>“Apologies, again. Another question…What is the official term for this process?”</p>

<p>Harry might be catching on, Hermione is not too sure.</p>

<p>“It's called an… investigation.”</p>

<p>Tears are streaming down Dean and Seamus's faces, which are now the same shade of violet as the Phoenix banner's overhead. A mischievous glint sparkles in Zabini's eyes when he sneaks a glance at the pair, obviously relishing in the game he's playing at. Zabini raises his hand in yet another attempt at inquiry. And suddenly there's a flash of movement on the dais as Ron emerges from behind—Hermione had not even known he was present. He's almost unrecognizable, dressed in a wool, grey, tartan waistcoat and a matching deerstalking cap —concealing the distinct copper of his hair. Ron roughly pushes Harry out of the way, staggers slightly, and grips the podium with one hand while the other aims at the crowd, a long finger pointing directly at Blaise Zabini.</p>

<p>“Oi! Listen here, wanker! Harry's here on important Ministry business, so you'd better listen up or we'll have you dragged off the Azkaban!”</p>

<p>Harry squeezes himself in next to Ron and places a gentle hand to his friend's shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, no Ron. Thanks, but we don't have clearance for that. Also, it's not really what we're here for. We're here to investigate, remember?” He emphasizes this novel information with a pleading look, Ron begrudgingly concedes and turns to readdress the crowd.</p>

<p>“Right. Well, we can't throw you in Azkaban—yet. But alls the same, it would do you best to listen or I'll come after you.”</p>

<p>To Hermione's annoyance, Harry unloads his frustrations onto his hair. “No. No, Ron. We cannot physically threat the students.”</p>

<p>“Oh sorry, listen or we'll take away away house points.”</p>

<p>“Ron! We cannot do that either.”</p>

<p>“Bloody hell, then why are we even here??”</p>

<p>The crowd replies in concert, “To investigate!”</p>

<p>Ron's face flushes the color of his hair and he throws his hands up in defeat. Harry gestures for him to return to his place, presumably far, far, away from the podium. Ron relents and storms off. Harry looks as if he's going to start another speech but to everyone's relief, McGonagall steps in.</p>

<p>“Now that we've been given an overview of what we should expect from the ministries presence here at Hogwarts, prefects, please return to your respective dormitories and update your houses. House of Phoenix, if you would please return to your common room, as your head of house will be conducting a mandatory assembly. Your presence is required, any students who do not report to the House of Phoenix common room will be cited and questioned.”</p>

<p>Hermione swallows. She looks over her shoulder at Theo, who stands in the back of the crowd. A day after the incident, his eye is considerably less puffy, but a purplish green bruise lingers under his eye. At least his teeth have returned to their normal state. He catches her glance and imparts a worried frown. As a whole, Theo looks awful. His robes are disheveled and his hair is greasy and unkept. Hermione's heart throbs. They are the only two who truly know what happened, and its visibly eating Theo alive. They need to strategize. Are they planning to tell the truth or keep a low profile? Over the past day it's been difficult to breathe. Each time her name is said, her body seizes with dread, overcome with the overwhelming fear that someone has figured it all out, has come to interrogate her. She can only imagine what Theo is feeling. When the crowd begins to disperse she aims directly for him with the purpose of sorting it all out. Two steps is all she takes when suddenly, she is waylaid by Harry and Ron.</p>

<p>“Hi.”</p>

<p>“Harry!” Hermione swiftly pulls him in for a tight hug, causing him to wheeze as the air is compressed from his lungs.</p>

<p>Hermione peeks over his shoulder to see Ron who is slowly inching himself away. She reaches for his waistcoat and roughly tugs him into the embrace. They allow her to squeeze them mercilessly and she loves them more for it. Suddenly, she realizes that her eyes are wet, she's crying. The shock of her own tears breaks through her defenses and unbridled emotions well up from deep within, sending her into a fit of sniffs and sobs. Her two loyal friends melt a little further into her embrace, both giving her pacifying pats on the back. Eventually, she pulls away, wipes her tears on her sleeve, and busies herself with inspecting them both.</p>

<p>Hermione's eyes are still red and puffy from tears when she reaches up to straighten Harry's collar and smooth over the rough bit of hair on his head.</p>

<p>“Right, well. Good job Harry. That was all very official.”</p>

<p>Harry smiles sheepishly in response and Hermione swells with pride for her friend. When Harry had first announced he'd taken the ministries offer after the war to train as an Auror, Hermione was ecstatic for him. All news after Voldemort's defeat seemed to add to the jubilee. Bill and Fluer announced their pregnancy, Kingsley became Minister, Harry was given an order of Merlin, along with herself and Ron, and had accepted his offer into the Auror training program. It was all wonderful, until it wasn't…</p>

<p>Hermione redirects her attention toward Ron and his strange attire.</p>

<p>“Now, you….Ronald… What are you wearing?” Ron puffs up his chest and supplies a smug smile.</p>

<p>“You like it?”</p>

<p>“It's very… Victorian… I suppose it's not bad… But why this look, in particular?”</p>

<p>Ron opens his mouth to reply when Harry suddenly breaks in.</p>

<p>“He's been watching The Adventure's of Sherlock Holmes on the telly.”</p>

<p>Hermione releases a small giggle, “Ohh. Yes, that would explain it.”</p>

<p>Ron flushes and furrows his brow at the floor. “Actually, I'm on the Memoirs now…”</p>

<p>“Oh, no Ron. I like it! It suits you. I was just a bit confused. But it does make you look rather smart.”</p>

<p>This seems to brighten Ron up and he returns to proudly puffing up his chest. Harry clears his throat and Hermione turns her attention back to him.</p>

<p>“So, Hermione… Do you know anything? I mean, its mad. The whole thing is unbelievable, someone had to be working with Professor Snape's Portrait. Though, we don't even have the means to properly interrogate it. The portrait has been thoroughly damaged from being at the bottom of the Black Lake for so long and it appears to be abandoned. We asked the other portraits if they've seen Snape, but no one has. Said they'd never spoken to him, even before, when he was hung in McGonagall's office. Apparently he was rude and unsociable. They eventually had to take him down because he wouldn't quit complaining about everything and insulting anyone who passed by. I just don't get it. Why would Snape try to kill Malfoy? And who hates Malfoy enough to want him dead? Have you seen or heard anything we could work with? I've been…”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>Harry's voice is drowned out by the clamorous sounds of her own heart. He's still rabbling and all she can think is STOP STOP STOP. Her vision is swimming, blurring into a hundred fragmented pieces of blinding light, black hair sticking on its ends and scratchy Scottish wool. She wants to run—hide away in some dusty corner of the castle and scream, stomp, cry.</p>

<p>Breathe Hermione.</p>

<p>Deep breaths. One, two, three.</p>

<p>Slowly, she reigns in her panic and begins to register Harry's voice, still rambling on…</p>

<p>“What about him? Theodore Nott, right? He doesn't look too good. Offly suspicious…”</p>

<p>Immediately, Hermione snaps back to the present.</p>

<p>“Theo? No, Theo is not a suspect. Yesterday, he was… He was with me.”</p>

<p>Harry blinks. “Oh.” His brows furrow in thought. “He's your…”</p>

<p>"Friend. Theodore is my friend.” Hermione heaves a breath and looks pleadingly into Harry's eyes. “Harry, He's a good bloke. Plus, he's Malfoy's best friend. He's been completely devastated by all of this. This has all been really hard on him.”</p>

<p>Harry gives an accepting nod, "Right. Well... We'd better head to your new common room then, Ron and I get to join in the fun." He supplies a shrewd wink, filling her with warmth that follows her all the way up to the Phoenix common room.</p>

<p>“Welcome to the Phoenix Common Room A.A. Fellowship! Please take your seat, anywhere will do, we will begin shortly.”</p>

<p>Hermione settles herself in a seat near the girl's dormitory stairs, preparing for a swift exit when things inevitably fall apart. Ginny, seemingly sharing the same sentiment, plops down onto the seat beside her.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he's referring to.”</p>

<p>“I am silently praying to Merlin that it is not what I think it is.”</p>

<p>“And what—.”</p>

<p>All members of the of Phoenix house appear to be present and situated so Professor NeatWanker begins speaking, depriving Ginny of the opportunity to ask her next question. Professor NeatWanker claims his own seat within the circle, wedging himself between an anguished looking Blaise Zabini and an enthusiastic Neville.</p>

<p>“My name is Blandus NeatWanker… I am a wizard and your secretary… Let us begin with a moment of silence and a plea to the heavens…”</p>

<p>Hermione directs a whisper at Ginny. “Oh God Ginny. It really is…”</p>

<p>“What?? What is it Hermione?”</p>

<p>Dean, a few seats down, ungraciously leans himself over Padma and Pavarti and finally indulges Ginny.</p>

<p>“This, is an A.A. meeting.”</p>

<p>Ginny, who still hasn't found the desired answer to her question, gives Hermione a pleading look.</p>

<p>“What is an A.A. meeting?"</p>

<p>“Well its a worldwide fellowship for alcoholism, famously known as Alcoholics Anonymous or A.A….This meeting seems loosely based on the same design.”</p>

<p>NeatWanker concludes his prayer and begins reciting a twelve step plan for the evening that does not make any sense. No one here is an alcoholic, besides possibly Ron, who has tagged along with Harry in the investigation, and is paying rapt attention to every word out of NeatWanker's mouth. Alright, one alcoholic. Besides that it's just Neville and his worried eyes, a nail picking Ginny who sits next to her, she supposes Theo and his potions could possibly count, begrudgingly she realizes her pill dependency is her own form of addiction.</p>

<p>“I understand some may find this affair to be confusing, as who here could truly call themselves an alcoholic?”</p>

<p>The rhetorical question is answered by a single hand, Ron. Belatedly, Ron realizes his mistake and sinks into his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes very good. Honesty is one of the most noble of qualities young man. Though many here may not deal with alcoholism per say, dependencies, habits and enslavements of the mind can be much more destructive than any substance. To be a slave to resentment, hate, fear, can can the greatest of interior perils. What has occurred to one of our students here at Hogwarts is a tragedy, and could have been prevented. I hope today you will learn a bit about how we can understand each other and find commonalities in our differences. Today, I would like us to begin with honesty…”</p>

<p>Honesty. Professor NeatWanker's voice grows to a distant hum in the back of her mind, she's falling down the rabbit hole of her own thoughts. The truth of the matter is that all of this stems from her. Her request for more of Theo's potion, her insistence on taking that blasted box from the Potion's Room extended cabinet, all because she had commanded Theo to get rid of it, resulting in his throwing it out the window. Her mind drifts back to the last time she'd seen Malfoy, to her parting words.</p>

<p>“One of these days Malfoy…You will get what's coming to you… You won't even know what hit you.”</p>

<p>Her exact words had come to pass.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Guilt rips its way through her, she considers running up the stares, fleeing, knocking down every pill left within her bottle, anything, Anything to make the guilt end. Resolute in her mission to make an indiscreet exit, Hermione covertly looks around, then stills. All eyes are on her.</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>Ginny nudges her with an elbow and lowers to her ear in a soft whisper. “Your name and your personal take on the virtue of honesty.”</p>

<p>Oh. Her eyes fall back down to her lap. It's an easy question. Simple.</p>

<p>“My name is Hermione Granger…. and honesty is…” Thump. Thump. Thump, “Honesty is… It's important because…”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>There's a burst of giggles from a few seats down and Hermione glances over to see a smug looking Tracy Davis.</p>

<p>“Wow, The Hermione Granger at a loss for words. I suppose she's not as brave without pious Potter and weirdo Weasely at her side.”</p>

<p>Ginny's hand jerks toward the pocket she stores her wand in, but Professor NeatWanker is quicker.</p>

<p>“Now, now, remember. This is all about unity, understanding, about treating your fellow classmates with respect. If Ms. Granger does not wish to share this round, she can pass like Ms. Parkinson.” Hermione doesn't meet the professors eyes when she nods, passing the prompt to Ginny.</p>

<p>“Ginny Weasley here. Honesty is crucial because people have the right to know who the slags walking around exactly are." She punctuates this statement by fixing her gaze directly on Davis.</p>

<p>“How dare you!” It's a flash of movement before, Davis and Ginny are both on their feet, brandishing their wands at one another. Professor NeatWanker and Harry rise too, the latter risks speaking in a pacifying tone.</p>

<p>“C'mon, girls. No need to get all riled. Remember what NeatWanker said, it's all about honesty. This is good, getting everything out in the open. You're making strides. Now let's put the bones to rest.”</p>

<p>Ginny's eyes narrow toward Harry, her nostrils flare, her lip twitching ever so slightly in a snarl. She's irate. Hermione makes note to never find herself on the receiving end of such a display.</p>

<p>“Yes… Honesty…everything out in the open…Putting bones to rest… Why, Harry, since you seem to be so knowledgeable in these matters, perhaps you can enlighten us. How, exactly, does ignoring and avoiding your girlfriend for weeks align with the definition of honesty? And please, do tell, how is silently breaking up with her and using the sorry excuse of needing space a noble attempt at being open, honest? What is the honest part about leading her on for years, only to leave her at the first opportunity?”</p>

<p>Oh Merlin. This is really happening, right now. Harry looks as if he's being cornered by a hoard of dementors, with not one happy memory to draw from. He begins stuttering and mumbling unintelligible sounds. There may be an “I” and a few “Erms” possibly a “never” and a “hurt” until finally, a definite “sorry” is coughed up.</p>

<p>An awkward beat of silence ensues until NeatWanker croaks like a frog in the dead of night.</p>

<p>“Please, students, Auror Harry, return to your seats. Honesty is about transparency, first with ourselves and then others. We cannot force others to be honest with us, if they are not first exercising honesty within themselves. Patience and acceptance are the keys to understanding truth.”</p>

<p>NeatWanker casts a furtive glance at Harry, then Ginny.</p>

<p>"Again, there's no pressure for anyone to feel obliged to explain themselves; honesty cannot be coerced.”</p>

<p>Harry swallows and nods at the professor before feebly sinking back into his chair. Ginny exhales a sigh, muttering a “Coward” before firmly resettling herself in her seat.</p>

<p>At the heed of NeatWanker, the session reconvenes and several share their inputs until finally, the turn lands on Neville, who is the last to share before reaching NeatWanker.</p>

<p>The room is tense with anticipation, everyone gathered eagerly awaiting for the ordeal to come to its end. They sit on the edge of their seats, silently urging Neville to hurry it up and get it over with.</p>

<p>“Hi, I'm Neville Longbottom. In my opinion, honesty is like water and a relationship is like a plant. Like water, honesty is necessary for a relationship to prosper, survive. When other's see honesty in action, they are drawn to it, it's necessary for nurturing friendships and cultivating new ones…”</p>

<p>“Yea, Neville. Real nice of you to cultivate friendships with the enemy huh. Like Parkinson. Tell us, you even thinking about spreading your seed?”</p>

<p>Terry Boot's tone is scornful and laced with derision. He's siting back in his chair with his arms crossed, an ankle resting over his knee.</p>

<p>Neville's neck flushes scarlet and his hands flex at his sides.</p>

<p>“I'm not here to hold grudges. Be it Parkinson, Zabini or even Malfoy… They all deserve a second chance. It's a year to show we truly are, Boot.”</p>

<p>Harry perks up from his slumped position, the subject matter broaching on far more intriguing territory. Harry takes his opportunity to leverage the discussion toward his objective.</p>

<p>“Great insights Neville! So why don't we go around the circle and share our thoughts on Malfoy.”</p>

<p>Groans ensue. Whatever Harry assumed would happen next, doesn't.</p>

<p>Zabini: “He's tolerable, on a good day. Best to avoid him the other 360 days of the year.”</p>

<p>Pansy: “No comment.”</p>

<p>Seamus: “In fifth, Prat told me I looked like an advertisement for contraceptive potion. Hated him since. Could've rolled into the bloody lake with that portrait for all I care.”</p>

<p>Bulstrode: “In fourth year he said ‘It's a shame that a freakishly large nose could mar perfectly good lineage.'”</p>

<p>A string of sniffing and whimpering erupt and nearby spectators pat Bulstrode's back sympathetically. The following subsequent minutes morph from “sharing our thoughts on Draco Malfoy” to “Why I, too, hate Draco Malfoy.”</p>

<p>Apparently, a third of the assembly openly harbor animosity toward Malfoy and wish to be rid of him in one way or another. Another third maintain indifference to his presence and actively avoid any circumstances which require them to directly interact with him. Theo, loyal until the end, preserves the last remnant of his degraded character, inciting that he is a “good fellow, underneath it all”. Hermione joins Parkinson in the vague realm of ‘no comment'.</p>

<p>Harry, no nearer to a breakthrough, appears frustrated—his list of potential suspects having somehow, expanded.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?”</p>

<p>Everyone seems to seize at Luna's curt question. Hermione swallows. Guilt continues twisting it's way up her spine, mocking her while coiling upward.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Harry releases a resigned sigh, “No. He's not dead… Pompey and several healers from St. Mungo's are currently treating him, but he appears to be in a state of prolonged unconsciousness. It's complicated. He's in, what is commonly known as a ‘Vegetative State' by muggles.”</p>

<p>Silence pulses through the room in heavy, dreadful waves, washing out all enmity and leaving only shame in its wake. All eyes sink to the floor, like a moment of silence for the dead. Hermione sinks herself further into her chair. Her spine aches to compress her chest cavity, coil into a ball and roll up the stairs and into her bed.</p>

<p>A clap splits the silence and all eyes aimed at the floor flit to Professor NeatWanker, who stands with clasped hands.</p>

<p>“I think that's all for tonight, folks.”</p>

<p>Chairs scape against stone as all the students silently rise and retreat up the stairs to their respective dorms. Hermione does not move. She casts a glance at Theo, who, along with herself, is of the last remaining seated. Bodies move around him in their retreat, but he continues to sit quietly, staring dejectedly at the floor. Brown hair falls messily over his eyes and his hands are balled into fists in his lap. A blotch of crimson hovers in her periphery so she pivots to face Ginny.</p>

<p>“Come on. Lets go up?”</p>

<p>“I will be up in in a bit. I need to talk to Theo.”</p>

<p>Ginny nods and offers Hermione a gentle hug. Hermione catches Harry's eyes over Ginny's shoulder as she is pulled into the embrace. His eyes linger on Ginny as she gingerly pulls away and makes her way up the stairs. Hermione swore to herself she wouldn't get in the middle of whatever is happening between her two friends, she loves them both too much. However, watching them suffer and slowly fall apart, is agonizing. If they could only see how much they mean to one another…</p>

<p>Hermione continues to watch as Harry defeatedly drops his gaze to the floor while Ginny disappears up the stairs. Theo approaches him then, seemingly pulling him from his stupor. What is Theo up to? Her curiosity eats at her as they share several words before finally, Harry nods to him and Theo's spirits seem to bolster. Hermione catches Theo's eyes as he departs from Harry, delivering her a subtle quirk of his head, toward the common room exit. He is most definitely up to something.</p>

<p>Hermione joins Harry and Ron, accompanying them towards the exit of the common room. She offers them both a final hug, then watches as they leave through the door. After waiting a few moments to ensure they are gone, she follows suit. The corridor is silent, the click of her shoes the only sound as she makes her way down the hall. Where is he? She can't stifle the yelp that escapes her lips as she is suddenly pulled into a dark alcove.</p>

<p>“Theodore!”</p>

<p>“Shh. We're not supposed to be out of the dorms.”</p>

<p>“Then what are we doing out here?”</p>

<p>“I asked Harry and he's allowed us to go, but we still can't be seen by anyone else.”</p>

<p>“And where are we going, Theodore?”</p>

<p>“To see Draco.”</p>

<p>Hermione regards the sight of Malfoy's still form on the small infirmary bed. The bed is small, nearly too small to fit his entire frame. He lays there, rigid and tense, covered in a thin, scratchy sheet that drapes over the lower half of his body. She immediately regrets coming. Seeing Draco Malfoy— her childhood bully, the man who watched as she was tortured on his drawing room floor, the prat who can, at any given moment, effortlessly snake his way under her skin—like this; feels wrong.</p>

<p>Hermione would have never imagined she had any particular expectations regarding Draco Malfoy's behavior or conduct, given his character. Insulting her (and others), threatening or hexing those who get in his way, manipulation, torture… All of it, falls under her umbrella of, “The expected behaviours of a one Draco Malfoy”. In a very strange and twisted way, these expectation comfort Hermione; they are reliable. Although, the Draco Malfoy lying before her is not the same man; he is exposed, powerless, and vulnerable. It's unnerving.</p>

<p>The Malfoy before her is donned in white infamary robes, far from the usual oxfords she's used to seeing. His arms are exposed, revealing a fading dark mark on his left forearm. She releases a shaky breath. Unnerving doesn't quite capture the feeling of the situation, It's indecent. Her discomfort peaks when she finally gathers the courage to glance at his face. Fine, white-blonde hair falls delicately across his forehead. The cheeks of his face are gaunt and shallow, his skin paler than she has ever seen before. A bandage rests at his temple, concealing the expanse of skin where he was struck.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Hermione swallows. The faint lines between his brows and at the corners of his mouth are the only indicators that his expression is typically adorned by a perpetual scowl. Though now, with the scowl quelled, he appears so young, so… peaceful…</p>

<p>Hermione tilts her head, having never before noticed the elegant slope of his nose, the artistic proportions of sharp lines to soft skin. His lips, usually kept in a pinched line are relaxed, gentle, pursed.</p>

<p>Theo's voice splinters the solemn vigil, “I've never seen him like this…”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately straightens up and tucks her hair behind her ear, attempting to conceal the fact that she was just staring at Draco Malfoy while he lay unconscious, “Are you alright?”</p>

<p>“I'll be fine.” Theo takes a seat on the chair at Malfoy's bedside and runs his hands through his hair. “I don't know how this has happened Hermione. I don't know what I was thinking. Fuck. I fucking murdered him.”</p>

<p>“Theo… He's not dead. He's only unconscious. They will heal him, and he'll be back to his usual prat-like self in no time.”</p>

<p>“You heard them, he's not responding to any of their treatments, he's in a ‘vegetative state' as they put it. Nothing is working..”</p>

<p>“It has been one day, Theo.”</p>

<p>Hermione takes Theo's hand in hers and gently rubs her thumb across the back. She wishes she could help, wishes she could alleviate the guilt he feels. But she knows she can't; she is helpless to quell her own. They sit there in silence for many moments until finally, he releases his hand from hers and solemnly pats her own.</p>

<p>“I need to… Narcissa asked that I put this on him.”</p>

<p>Theo reaches into the pocket of his robes and withdraws a long silver chain adorned with an onyx stone. He holds it in his hand, lightly brushing his finger over it. Hermione watches as it glimmers ever so slightly.</p>

<p>“Would you help me?”</p>

<p>She continues to stare at the stone, it's captivating. Theo offers it to her and she takes it into her hand, inspecting it greedily. Hermione has always had a penchant for enchanted objects. When infused with magic, an item undergoes a transformation from its original function, and its potential uses become boundless. The uses of a teakettle may be limited in the muggle world, but once enchanted with magic... The teakettle can transform into an international Portkey to Brazil, or be cursed to sicken anyone who pours a cup of tea from it, or be defiled to hold a piece of a man's soul. Hermione wonders whether the object in her hand is infused with any dark magic, whatever kind it be, it's undoubtedly powerful.</p>

<p>The stone is an emerald cut, approximately the size of the top of her pinky. Upon closer examination, she discerns it is not entirely black, but a shade of green so dark that its exact color can only be revealed through close inspection. The magic is palpable and eager, seemingly receptive to her touch, emanating radiant pulses as she delicately sweeps her fingers over its surface.</p>

<p> Still captivated by the stone, she silently questions Theo. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“It's a protective stone, meant to safeguard those who wear it. A black family heirloom imbued with very old, ancient magic.”</p>

<p>Hermione finally breaks her mesmerized trance and looks up to find Theo regarding her with an odd expression. “Narcissa entrusted me with it, to… to put it on him.”</p>

<p>Her attention returns to the stone in her hands, then briefly flicks to Malfoy, helpless in the infirmary bed. Not for him, but for Theodore.</p>

<p>“Okay, Theo. I'll help you.”</p>

<p>A small, grateful expression passes over his face. Doesn't he already know she could never deny him this? That she would do anything in this moment to help? Anything to quell the despair which currently possesses him? The familiar string of guilt resumes its winding up her spine.</p>

<p>Your fault, your fault, all you.</p>

<p>Theo rises and leans over the bed, snaking his arm under Malfoy's neck. She surmises he is leaning down to hug his friend, but in one swift motion, he heaves Malfoy into an upright position. Malfoy's limp body complies, his head lulling to the side and onto Theo's shoulder. Theo grunts from the dead weight of his friend.</p>

<p>“Alright quick, put it on him.”</p>

<p> Hermione blanches. “What? Me?”</p>

<p> Theo huffs in response. “Well obviously. Unless you want to hold him up instead?”</p>

<p> He lifts a brow in her direction and Hermione reluctantly approaches the bedside. Her fingers shake in her attempt to undo the clasp of the necklace. Several moments pass before she successfully frees it. She leans towards Malfoy, attempting to reach for his neck, but damned Theo is in the way, making it a difficult endeavor. The entire situation is awkward, the angle even more-so. Her arms stretch to their limits and in her feeble attempt, she unintentionally bumps into Theo, eliciting an annoyed grunt from him. </p>

<p>“I can't hold him up properly when your shoving at me like that.”</p>

<p> Hermione releases a frustrated huff. “He's too far. I can't quite reach his neck with you in the middle.”</p>

<p>"Just... just move to the other side of the bed."</p>

<p>Hermione nods reluctantly and moves to the other side of the bed. Theo tilts Malfoy's body slightly towards her, intensifying the discomfort of the ordeal. Apart from their incident with the papers, she's never been this close to Malfoy, and now she has to touch him, his neck of all places. Hermione buries those futile thoughts and focuses. All she has to do is clasp the necklace; it is simple, clinical. She steels herself with all the self assurance she can muster. You can do this. However, a faint bell tolls in the back of her mind, like Daedalus warning Icarus on his flight.</p>

<p>She reaches her arm around Malfoy, steadying the necklace in place as she attempts to join the other end. While fumbling to secure the clasp, her fingers lightly brush against the nape of his neck. As Theo had mentioned, the necklace is ancient and appears reluctant to be re-clasped.</p>

<p>“You need to recite an incantation.”</p>

<p>She startles, allowing the necklace to slip from her grasp and fall to the bed.</p>

<p>“What?? No Theo, I can't.”</p>

<p>He brushes her off, nudging Malfoy a little closer in a failed attempt at encouragement.</p>

<p>“It's simple, just repeat after me…Custodiosempra.”</p>

<p>Hermione winces, already aware that the hole she's in was dug by her own, bare hands,“Custodiosempra.”</p>

<p>“Okay, now, Legarementum omni.”</p>

<p>Her heart begins pounding loudly in her chest. “Le…. Legrementum omni.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You have to repeat exactly as I do, or it won't work, now again.”</p>

<p>Hermione follows Theo's directions until finally, she is able to recite the entire incantation on her own.</p>

<p>“Custodiosempra. Legarementum omni, vasis infusumo. Fidelius totalementi, Ligatus Totales.”</p>

<p>Thump. Thump. Thump.</p>

<p>The moment she finishes, the stone pulses in her hand, and a bright beam of light rises to the surface before retreating back into the dark depths of the stone. Immediately, the clasp secures itself around Malfoy's neck, and the chain, still within her grasp, radiates warmth.</p>

<p>Hermione releases it and steps back.</p>

<p>“So…It's done then?”</p>

<p>She watches as Theo delicately rests Malfoy's body back down onto the mattress. It squeaks as he pulls away and moves to stand at her side</p>

<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>Side by side, they silently regard Malfoy, who lies peacefully in the bed. Hermione's gaze flits to the necklace now adorning Malfoy's chest. It looks plain now, all magic and power withdrawn into the dark abyss of the stone.</p>

<p>They remain there for several moments, staring at him in the same way they had when they first arrived. However, now—something feels different, strange. Hermione has the sense that some small, subtle change has occurred. An unfolding.</p>

<p>The nameless feeling follows her all the way back to the Phoenix common room, up the stairs, to her room, and into her bed. She cannot ignore the indistinct feeling that she, like Icarus, had somehow flown too close to the sun and now finds herself falling into the abyss.</p>

            <div>
<p>Marching purposefully down the corridor, Hermione channels her frustration into each deliberate footfall. She's determined to broadcast her foul mood to anyone who dares to cross her path, a blatant scowl marks her face, sending a clear message to those with the most minute smidgen of intellect: Stay Away.</p>

<p>Paying no heed to the Aurors stationed about, she strides past with resolve, demonstrating just how ineffective she finds their attempts at intimidation. She's completely fed up with the lot of them— the constant loitering in every corridor, the hushed whispers, the unwarranted probing of first years. As if a first-year could even hoist Professor Snape's portrait, let alone fling it out a window. Barreling past a particularly shifty group, she ensures they witness the tightening of her grip on her wand. One Auror, catching sight of this, recoils further into the alcove, leaving her feeling rather smug.</p>

<p>That's right, stay away.</p>

<p>Following the Malfoy incident, utter bedlam has ensued at Hogwarts. Aurors are everywhere, including Harry and Ron, the latter having taken up a magnifying glass, inspecting every crevice of stone in the castle. To exacerbate matters, McGonagall deemed it an ideal time to commence 'minor refurbishments' on the school. Naturally, this decision was prompted by a Daily Prophet article detailing numerous grievances, from parents who question the ‘structural integrity' of the first-century building — particularly in light of recent events, i.e. the Battle of Hogwarts and more specific concerns related to portraits hurtling out of windows.</p>

<p>When the repairs began, it was, of course in, of all places- her corner of the library. Hermione had arrived at her usual spot, only to find several wizards donned in dungarees loitering about the area. Apparently, a leaky drain from the prefect's bathroom above was causing water to swell behind the walls of the library, producing a ‘flourishing colony deadly mold'.</p>

<p>Deprived of her usual refuge within the library, and with the remainder of the castle now under constant DMLE surveillance, she is left scouring the halls for an abandoned classroom or a quiet alcove—anywhere that will provide a fraction of peace.</p>

<p>Testing every door along the current hall, she discovers they are all firmly locked.</p>

<p>Bloody Aurors and their security measures.</p>

<p>Hermione momentarily considers returning to the Phoenix common room, but promptly abandons the idea when she envisions her housemates huddled together, gossiping about the “Malfoy Mystery”, which has failed to settle in any capacity nearly a week later.</p>

<p>No. She needs a quiet place to work on her assignments, somewhere she can be left alone, completely undisturbed. As she continues her march up another level, her patience begins to wane, resulting in her sifting through parchments while in step. Charms, Ancient Runes, and Arithmancy all have papers due in exactly one week. Flipping through the pages, she mutters the assignment instructions aloud to herself:</p>

<p>Charms: A three-foot essay on the comparison and contrast of the five Protego charms.</p>

<p>Ancient Runes: A four-foot essay on the differentiation of Long-branch and short-twig runes in application.</p>

<p>Arithmency: Five tables on the—.”</p>

<p>Hermione lets out a startled squeal as she trips over the last stair, causing the parchment and books to fly from her arms and scatter across the floor. Muttering curses under her breath, she hastily regathers her belongings and shoves them roughly back into her bag. Rising to stand, she brushes dirt from her knees, when suddenly, she finds herself blinded by a ray of light. Scanning her surroundings, she realizes she is in the entrance hall of the infirmary wing. The door to the infirmary has been left slightly ajar, allowing light to spill into the corridor.</p>

<p>Hermione considers—</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>She turns on her heel, ready to leave when she notices it— The silence. This portion of the castle is completely quiet and devoid of people.</p>

<p>Well, maybe…</p>

<p>Succumbing to desperation, she surrenders all remaining sanity and allows her steps to guide her through the door. It pushes aside with a faint creak, granting just enough room for her head to peek around it and survey the still room. For a moment she stands there, dithering with uncertainty before she firmly sets aside her nerves and shimmies through the door. The space is bright, spacious, and tranquil.</p>

<p>Floor-to-ceiling windows lining the back wall are framed by white, flitting drapes, casting a picturesque view of the landscape below. Illuminated by the afternoon sun, the evergreen rolling hills of high Scotland stretch into the distance. Hermione draws close to the window and places a hand to the glass. While green grass stretches in every direction, small clues foretell the changing of the season; subtle shades of crimson adorn some trees and the early fall winds sweep over. A few leaves are unfastened from their perches and swirl about the skies in a final adieu. One brave leaf journeys past her hand held to the glass, it flitters midair for a moment in a tender ‘hello', before it is swept away again by the wind.</p>

<p>She follows in step with the runaway leaf, her gaze never departing from its flitting across the windows of the infirmary. She watches as it prances behind the glass, one moment dipping behind the stone only to reappear in the following moment at the next set of windows. She is so entranced by the leaf that she does not notice where her steps are leading her until her shin collides with a most unforgiving metal. In the same abrupt moment, the leaf falls in a quick descent.</p>

<p>She bends down to massage her aching leg and is taken aback when she notices Malfoy lying in the bed before her. A gasp escapes her lips as she stumbles backward. Belatedly, it dawns on her that he is still unconscious, likely unaware of her presence. She contemplates departing, but then... she weighs the quietude and the well-lit room…</p>

<p>“I hope you don't mind. But honestly, it really doesn't matter what you think. I need somewhere quiet to work, and the infirmary, as it happens, is the last place in Hogwarts with a modicum of peace. I'll try not to bother you too much, but, well- I suppose it doesn't exactly matter if I do, because you're a prat and don't have any say in this."</p>

<p>Finishing her speech, she waits for a response from unconscious Malfoy and when she receives absolutely diddly-squat, she drops her satchel at the foot of Malfoy's bed, and quickly gets to work.</p>

<p>The beds in the infirmary are rather lightweight and can be easily moved by hand, so she decides to do it herself. She's hesitant to use a Locomotion Charm, fearing she might inadvertently disturb the man in the bed and, knowing her luck, possibly send him into an even deeper state of unconsciousness. Instead, she carefully maneuvers around to the opposite side of the bed, to Malfoy's left, and gently pushes it closer until it's touching his own. She repeats this with the bed to his right and concludes the creation with a sticking charm on either side of the mattress.</p>

<p>Malfoy now lies in a bed fit for a Giant.</p>

<p>This. This will do… Now…</p>

<p>Moving to the foot of the bed, she clumsily empties her satchel, scattering parchment and books across the expanded mattress. Then, she begins lecturing the man in the bed.</p>

<p>"Alright, Malfoy, you're officially part of this now. Yes, I am aware that you don't have a choice and your helpfulness is somewhat limited due to the coma you're currently in. However, in this situation, I find your state of unconsciousness rather preferable compared to your usual self. You are quiet, still, and lacking a great deal of snark— which is, in every way, a blessing. I have decided that you're going to help me study. There are three assignments due within the next week, utterly ridiculous, I know. I've never been so short on time for an assignment in my life. I need to lay out all my resources and materials, and I'll be using the bed to do this. This is where you come in. Your left side will be reserved for Charms, your right for Ancient Runes, and the lower half of the bed will be designated for Arithmancy. How does that sound?"</p>

<p>Silence ensues.</p>

<p>"Perfect. Knew you wouldn't argue.”</p>

<p>Several hours pass as she works on her assignments. Occasionally, she engages in conversation with Malfoy and is pleased by his responses, which are consistently, utter silence. Over the course of the afternoon, she finds she enjoys speaking to Malfoy, not only due to his unwavering quietude but also the act of confiding her thoughts in some place other than her own mind is alleviating, having her feel a bit less lonely. She tells herself that, he too, might find some comfort in her company as well.</p>

<p>The waning of the sun and the rumbling of her stomach urges her to depart for supper, but she has one assignment left and cannot find enough reason to abandon ship quite yet. Seated on the bed next to Malfoy, her back propped against the metal headboard, she eyes her progress on the Runes assignment. With only one foot left to go, her brain is devoid of anything else to write.</p>

<p>“Malfoy, please tell me how, in Merlin's bloody name, I am supposed to write a four-foot essay comparing long-branch and short-twig ruins with only two measly pages in the textbook to reference from. And Ah, before you begin telling me to “check the library”, I already have! There are exactly four texts on Ancient Runes in the entire Hogwarts library, and three of them are colloquial stories of wizards discovering them in abandoned caves and on the side of trees! Nothing, absolutely nothing, remotely close to intellectual analys—,”</p>

<p>“Hermione?”</p>

<p>Hermione freezes, her cheeks and ears are set ablaze with embarrassment. Ginny stands at the door to the infirmary, looking utterly flabbergasted. Hermione's brain can't quite find a way to get herself out of the compromising position she's found herself in. How does one go about explaining why it's perfectly innocent to be alone, sitting in bed, studying, and conversing—yes, Ginny had walked in on that—next to their unconscious former enemy? She can't, so she instead, opts for deflection.</p>

<p>“Ginny, why are you here?”</p>

<p>Ginny seems taken aback by the fact that she is the one needing to answer that question, rather than the other way around. She scoffs, “Why am I here? Hermione, I've been scouring the castle for you. When you didn't turn up for lunch or dinner, I got worried, so I started searching for you. You weren't in any of your usual spots, and when I inquired about you, everyone claimed they hadn't seen you since this morning. I was on the verge of checking the Chamber of Secrets next, fearing you might have landed yourself in trouble again.”</p>

<p>Ginny quirks a suspicious brow. "However, it seems I might not have been completely wrong…”</p>

<p>Hermione shifts to the edge of the bed, rising into a stance that attempts to convey confidence and self-assurance, though summoning these feelings from within herself feels futile.</p>

<p>“I was—erm. I'm studying.”</p>

<p>Ginny's incredulous red brow does not relent. “Malfoy or the books?”</p>

<p>“The books of course!”</p>

<p>“Hmm. That seems debatable. Why do you have your books and papers strewn all over him like that?” Ginny motions to the piles of books surrounding Malfoy's form and some of the parchments on top of him.</p>

<p>Hermione takes a deep breath, rallying her patience, “I was using his body to separate my assignments into clear areas, it helps me think. Come on Ginny, you can't seriously think I'd be dallying with him.” She lowers her voice to a hushed whisper, “He's practically half-dead!”</p>

<p>“Again, debatable. I'm sure if he had a say in the ways in which Hermione Granger was using his body while he lay unconscious, he wouldn't be particularly keen on this.” Again, Ginny's gestures to the books and parchment covering him. “So he's helping you study then?”</p>

<p>“Well, sort of. I didn't come here for Malfoy in particular, I was looking for someplace quiet to study and happened to find myself in the infirmary. There are no men in dungarees making a ruckus, no DMLE hovering around creeping me out, or Ron peering at pebbles through a magnifying glass. No one, It's just empty space.”</p>

<p>“I get it. So Malfoy just so happens to be the only person who gets you all to himself on your birthday?”</p>

<p>Why, Why, Why, is this so difficult to explain?</p>

<p>“Honestly, Malfoy is beside the point, I needed a place to study that is quiet. It's quiet here. And… quite peaceful. Malfoy just so happens to come with the space. I did not deliberately come here for him. ” Hermione emphasizes the last expression, in an effort to convince the prying witch. And herself.</p>

<p>“Alright, I don't mean to be difficult. Just a little weird you know? I mean you despise one another, I'm half surprised I didn't find you in here finishing the job. Anyway, forget Malfoy, C'mon Hermione it's your birthday! We need to celebrate! Join me on a stroll to Honeyduke's, and I'll promise to get you completely knackered. My treat.”</p>

<p>“Gin it's a Thursday, I have a full day of classes tomorrow, I really can't. I need to start with the runes assignment, I haven't had any time to—.”</p>

<p>“It's okay Hermione, I get it. You don't need to explain it to me, I'm not going to drag you there against your will. It's your birthday, it should be fun and relaxing, not stressful.”</p>

<p>Hermione lets out a weighted breath. Ginny, who can be a bit blunt at times, has never compelled Hermione to do anything. She's never been like Harry or Ron, who often criticize her for her pedantic tendencies or her compulsive need to disappear and delve into her coursework. Ginny has always been there, a loyal and supportive figure, respecting her neurotic behaviors and never asking for more than what Hermione wants to share.</p>

<p>Nibbling her lip in thought, Hermione runs her fingers along the spine of the book in her hands, and looks up to Ginny, “How about tomorrow night? I was thinking of going out to muggle London to see an old friend, he has this club…”</p>

<p>Ginny leans her hip against the footboard of the bed and clamps the heel of her palm to her forehead. “Oh bother, Hermione…I have Quidditch tryouts on Saturday, at the ungodly hour of five in the bloody morning. I'm sorry… How about Sunday?”</p>

<p>“Oh…” Hermione looks back down at the spine of her book, trying to hide the despondency in her expression. “Yes—erm, Sunday works.”</p>

<p>A warm freckled hand reaches out and tugs Hermione's wrist free from her preoccupied stroking of the book's spine. Blistered fingers stoke across the back of Hermione's wrist.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry Hermione. It really does sound wicked, I've never been to muggle London. Next time?”</p>

<p>Hermione captures Ginny's hand in her own and nods. “Absolutely Ginny, next time.”</p>

<p>Ginny sweeps her into a tight hug, strangling all previous unease into the ether. “Oh! I almost forgot!” Ginny pulls back and digs a hand through her robes, producing a small lilac box, “Happy Birthday, Hermione.”</p>

<p>Taking the box in hand Hermione turns it over, inspecting the dainty flowers on the wrapping, charmed to swirl and pop in and out of existence.</p>

<p>“Well, go on then. Open it!”</p>

<p>Obeying the command, Hermione gently unfurls the wrapping paper and opens the black box. Inside, lying on a thin bed of tissue paper is an object with likes similar to a compass.</p>

<p>“I snagged it from WWW. It's a prototype, they haven't quite put it out for sale yet but they've been producing them. George calls it a ‘craving compass' or is it a “seeking star”? Not exactly sure, but that's beside the point, supposedly, it directs you to what you need most— or is it what you want most? If I'm being honest I don't actually know much about it, but I saw it and I thought of you. Anyway, if you are near your target, it's supposed to spin and pop. So… Happy Birthday!”</p>

<p>“That's sweet of you Gin. Thank you.” Hermione smiles and pulls her into a hug.</p>

<p>“Even though I can't go out on Friday, I want to help you get ready, alright? We'll make you look hot.”</p>

<p>“Theo, would you like to go out tonight?”</p>

<p>Propping himself up on his elbows, Theo imparts a sideways glance at Hermione, who still lounges peacefully on her back in the grass. She has become quite good at predicting when rubbish is about to spill forth from her friend's mouth, and so, discreetly reaches toward her book lying at her side.</p>

<p>“Like a date? Hermione dear, I hate to break your heart but I've told— ouch!”</p>

<p>Hermione pushes herself off the ground and settles next to him, delicately fingering the spine of her book, as if she hadn't just wielded it as a mallet.</p>

<p>“No you muppet. Just as friends.” She clarifies.</p>

<p>She allows her gaze to trail over the expanse of the grounds and her eyes fix on Hagrid's hut. It lies serenely in the distance, the looming presence of the forbidden forest is fruitless to hamper the tranquility of the small humble shack. She takes in the familiar sight, puffing smoke escaping from its chimney, pumpkins blooming in the front garden, and is reminded of a time that seems like lifetimes ago. She can almost make out the three children, naive, young, and fearless, skipping their way down the path to the hut. The girl, with her thick bushy hair, her eyes ablaze with determination, her veins coursing with hope, always confident and assured—pounds her tiny fists against the half-giants wooden door. Hermione looks away, and the children vanish into the breeze.</p>

<p>“Yesterday was my birthday” She admits.</p>

<p>The sound of a slap draws her attention to her friend. The palm of Theo's hand is pressed against his forehead.</p>

<p>“Your Birthday, Hermione? And you didn't tell me… Shite. I truly am a horrible friend, aren't I? First, I go and hospitalize one, then I—Ouch! Stop doing that would you?”</p>

<p>“Hush then!” Hermione lowers her book back down but keeps it close, in case of another slip-up. “Don't worry Theo, I'm not upset that you missed it. You would have never even known if I hadn't just told you. If you haven't already noticed, I'm not the sort to go parading it about, only a few close friends know when it is. Plus, birthdays haven't held the same significance to me for a while now. But I thought—well, it would be nice… You know, to go out, get our minds off—well, everything…” she mumbles.</p>

<p>“It sounds quite necessary at the current moment. What are you thinking?”</p>

<p>“Well how about muggle London?”</p>

<p>Hermione plucks a blade of grass from the dirt and twirls it around her finger. She's unsure of whether Theo will be up to her suggested plans, and finds it easier to focus on the blade of grass.</p>

<p>“Ohh… Sounds exciting, I've never been. And what, might I ask, would we do in muggle London Hermione?” Theo inquires curiously.</p>

<p>Feeling delighted by his apparent enthusiasm, she settles herself back down on the glass and closes her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, Theo.. There is this club…”</p>

<p>At ten minutes to nine, Hermione finds herself scrutinizing her attire in the mirror for perhaps the twentieth time. As with every previous occasion, no actual changes have been made, except for the repeated tucking-in and untucking of her blouse into the hem of her skirt. Another perplexing dilemma needles its way to the forefront of her mind: All buttons done up, or only the first two left undone? Or three? No, too much.</p>

<p>“You look positively gorgeous Hermione. I'm actually quite jealous. Something foul is growing in the pit of my stomach, it may be hate.” Ginny says, scrutinizing Hermione from head to toe.</p>

<p>“Stop. I have nothing to be jealous of, you're the one with legs to make a flamingo blush.”</p>

<p>Perched at the edge of her bed, Ginny lets out a snort.</p>

<p>"Not entirely sure if that's a compliment, but I'll accept it," she quips, punctuating her statement by hoisting a bare leg into the air for inspection, "They do look splendid, don't they? Especially when adorned with those clunky leg braces and paired with that ghastly helmet."</p>

<p>Hermione rolls her eyes, returning her attention to the mirror attempting to pat over her unruly hair.</p>

<p>“You choose to play that horrid game, all dangerous with those homicidal bowling balls…”</p>

<p>“Bowling Balls?” Behind her still-raised leg, Ginny's quizzical face pops up in the reflection of the mirror.</p>

<p>“Oh forget it,” Hermione turns to face Ginny, inquiring, "So, do I look alright?”</p>

<p>"Trying to impress Theo, are we? Or perhaps it's one of the Muggles?" Ginny teases, earning herself a shoe hurtling toward her head.</p>

<p>“Merlin no, not Theo. But I'll be seeing an old friend. I suppose I just want to feel confident tonight. Does that make any sense?”</p>

<p>Hermione smooths over her black miniskirt, shifting it a bit lower to cover her thighs. Having never had the opportunity before to wear it, she finds it pairs nicely with the black heeled knee-high boots and her plain white button-down blouse. Earlier, she had been disheartened to learn that her options of dress were disappointingly, limited. Apart from old tees and her Hogwarts uniform, she was surprised to discover that the single black skirt was her only suitable attire for an evening out. Although paired with her plain Hogwarts blouse, she finds it gives an edgy, yet sophisticated look, something she is surprised to find herself quite comfortable with. The boots, however, were hurdled at her head when Ginny discovered she was opting for her plain Mary Janes. Eyeing herself in the mirror she finds herself quite pleased with the result. She doesn't dare look at her hair, which she previously determined was a battle she'd rather not contend with.</p>

<p>"All you need is a tad bit of Mascara and you'll be ready,” Ginny assures her.</p>

<p>“I don't have any Mascara Ginny.” Hermione grumbles.</p>

<p>"It's alright, I nicked this from Lavender a few years back, and I've been using a refilling charm to keep it fresh."</p>

<p>Ginny forcefully nudges Hermione into a seat at her desk and begins rummaging through her drawers, extracting an assortment of cosmetics. She deposits a powder onto the desk, and Hermione inwardly groans at the sight. There is no possible way Ginny believes that that shade of moonlight-white is any shade near Hermione's own complexion. Several restless moments go by before Ginny finally locates the mascara, pops the wand from the bottle, and leans down to apply it. Hermione detects the globs of inky black just above her eyelashes and a knot of anticipation coils in her stomach, leaving her both excited and slightly nervous. Finally, Ginny pulls back, and tilts her head from side to side, appraising her job. Hermione squirms under the heavy weight of suspense, until finally, Ginny announces, “Abso-bloody-lutely Perfect.”</p>

<p>They had agreed to meet at the entrance doors at nine-thirty. At nine fifty-five, she begins to wonder whether a side dish of Theodore Nott would be best served as seared, broiled, or skewered. Tapping her foot ferociously on the stone floor, Hermione makes up her mind to storm his room, when finally, his lanky form slinks from the shadows.</p>

<p>“Sorry I'm late, I was having some difficulties sorting out my attire.” He mumbles.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I'll be sure to allocate an extra two hours before our next hurrah so you have ample time to sort your attire.”  she quips satirically. "Come on, let's get a move on. We don't want to be late.”</p>

<p>They walk in tandem to the edge of the Hogwarts wards, then apparate the rest of the way to Hogsmeade. They make a quick trip via flow to the leaky, and a final side-by-side apparition to an alleyway in central London. By the time they meet their destination, Hermione finds herself out of sorts. She hurls into a nearby trash bin.</p>

<p>“Merlin, that was not pleasant. I am not looking forward to the journey home.”</p>

<p>“It's a shame casting with grace, was not a requirement for the apparition test.” Theo drawls.</p>

<p>“Excuse me?”</p>

<p>Theodore brandishes a teasing smirk, “Just channeling my inner Draco, you know, in case I need to turn down a few lovesick souls tonight.”</p>

<p>“Right, Theodore.” she grumbles, “Come on, let's change out of these robes.”</p>

<p>They make quick work of divesting their robes and shrinking them down to fit back into Hermione's beaded bag.</p>

<p>"Nice outfit, Hermione, very muggle," Theo remarks.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Theo." Hermione completes her task of securing their robes in her bag and looks up at Theo, her expression shifting to one of shock at the sight of him. She does a double take, unable to believe what she's seeing. "Theodore, what in Merlin's name are you wearing?”</p>

<p>“I did a little research earlier- that's why I was taking so long you see, I had to borrow some clothes. What do you think, nifty isn't it?”</p>

<p>Hermione wearily regards the boldly eccentric and bright-colored plaid business suit, with its vibrant—no— nearly neon, greens, blues, and yellows. It looks to be unearthed from some lost nook of the 60's.</p>

<p>She swallows her obvious horrified reaction, trying to opt for saying something a bit more polite, “Nifty— Yes, I suppose that is a word.” She gives up entirely on the polite front and retreats back to blunt honesty, “I'm sorry Theo, but you look ridiculous. You look like a dodgy businessman from the 1960s, looking to sell me some kind of useless cleaning spray or a pack of rusty knives. Wherever did you find this, monstrosity?”</p>

<p>“Erm— Dean— he let me borrow it. I'm a bit miffed because he said this was passed down from his father as his most prized and cherished suit! Said it would be the talk of the town.”</p>

<p>“Well, he's not wrong…” she admits.</p>

<p>"And AND, It wasn't even a free loan! I had to agree to do his Herbology essay. , In the end, Neville's the one who'll be doing it because I helped him land a date with Pansy. Now convincing Pansy to go out with Neville was a bit more complicated, I promised I would get her out of our next month's visit to Narciss, though honestly, it's no big loss, considering how dreadfully dull she's been as of late..."</p>

<p>Ignoring Theo's rambling, Hermione focuses her energy on his suit, which must go at all costs. “Maybe if we just…”</p>

<p>She waves her wand over it, transforming the waistcoat and button-down into an Oasis band tee. With another swish of her wand, The cufflinks from the vanished dress shirt become faux diamond earrings, which are secured in place with a sticking charm. Then she moves onto the trousers that are easily transfigured into a baggy pair of blue denims. Wand to chin, she ponders the best way to transform the hideous Suit jacket. She determines that for Theo, only boldness will do, and transfigures the jacket into a denim jacket that matches his baggy trousers. Hermione steps back, and Theo looks like he could've been plucked straight out of a 90s American boy band.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>She clasps her hands together, pleased with her handiwork.</p>

<p>"What about the shoes?" he probes anxiously.</p>

<p>“I cannot for the life of me transfigure a pair of trainers. Those will just have to do. Don't worry too much, that's why I made the pants extra baggy. Come on, let's go.”</p>

<p>Rounding the corner of the alley they reach the address. The building is rather unimpressive: There is a cafe, closed for the evening, and a children's ballet studio, and wedged between the two shops lies a pair of steel doors that mark the exact number on the calling card.</p>

<p>One would not suspect a nightclub hiding behind the building's brick facade, if it were not for the burley-looking man— decked with rippling muscles and scratchy stubble—sitting on a precarious-looking stool in front of the steel doors.</p>

<p>And of course, the queue.</p>

<p>The long, winding queue, which snakes itself around the corner, bearing partygoers from all walks of life. It is reminiscent of a scene from a wildlife documentary on the telly: packs of young ladies, dressed in scanty attire, roam about. Meanwhile, solitary and shifty-looking men with long, unruly hair and numerous piercings adorning every visible inch of their ears, noses, and even a few eyebrows, lurk around as they watch the women with predatory hunger in their eyes. Countless tattooed arms and backs are bared, displaying an artistic scene of laughing devils, fiery hearts, and several dates presumably signifying important people or changes in their lives.</p>

<p>Theo quirks his brow in question, never having had to wait in a queue in his life. She rolls her eyes, tugging him along with her toward the front doors. As the burly-looking security guard comes into clearer view, she reconsiders her tentative plans. The man is almost six feet tall on a stool, and the size of his arms rivals Hagrid's own. Perhaps she should call Jocaob instead, but it's too late, the gruff man spots her and surveys them. His eyes trail over them, from the tops of their heads to their toes. His gaze lingers a few extra moments on Theo's odd pair of dress shoes, and Hermione tugs him a tad closer into her side. At last, the tension snaps as he finishes his assessment. He then nods towards the end of the street, where the line stretches and vanishes around the corner. Hermione internally winces, she will have to explain...</p>

<p>She reaches onto her tiptoes, drawing as close as possible to the man, holds her breath so as not to smell him, and whispers, “Hi. Erm— we're here to climb Jacob's ladder.”</p>

<p>His glare is both surprised and suspicious, he takes his time scanning both her and Theo anew. Theo's grip around her arm tightens when, once more, his gaze lingers a little too long on Theo's shoes. Hermione clings to her courage, fighting the urge to retreat to the back of the line, and tilts her chin up defiantly.</p>

<p>Finally, the man nods and unlatches a velvet rope allowing them to pass through. Several partygoers from the queue stand looking miffed with their arms crossed.</p>

<p>Theo leans down into her ear whispering, “Well quite special aren't you Hermione?"</p>

<p>Hermione brushes him off by explaining in a hushed voice, “The owner, I know him… He's a friend from primary school, and my old neighbor.”</p>

<p>When they reach the double steel doors, the burly guard knocks on the door in some kind of prison-inspired cryptography, and it opens, allowing them both to file in.</p>

<p>The explosion of noise and light momentarily stuns her, and a twinge of regret begins to take root within her; it's almost overwhelming. She feels a tug on her arm and glances back to Theo, who discreetly slips a potion vial into the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>“Happy Birthday, Hermione,” he blurts out.</p>

<p>“When did you make this?”</p>

<p>“Well…just been trying to keep myself busy.” He admits in a sad sort of confession.</p>

<p>“Right… Hey, Theodore! Let's make a toast. To a night of no worries!” Hermione raises her vial like a glass of champagne.</p>

<p>“Of no worries!” Theo repeats.</p>

<p>“To a night of fun!” She declares.</p>

<p>“A night of fun!”</p>

<p>Their vials clink upon impact like the toll of a bell, and they quickly tip the contents back. Bursting into a fit of giggles, they follow the pulse of music beckoning them deeper into the club. Guided by the magnetic pull of rumbling bass, they wander through a long and dimly lit hall lined with graffiti art and velvet settees, occupied by several partygoers—some in various stages of affection, others completely lost in revelry.</p>

<p>Walking deeper into the club, they step into a vast space reminiscent of an old industrial factory. Strobe lights in hues of blue, green, purple, and red, ricochet in every direction, bouncing off the graffitied walls, onto the people dancing above in the rafters and over the tightly packed crowd on the main floor. It is hazy, hot and loud. Bass reverberates underfoot, concealing the beat of her own pounding heart. Music is everywhere, coursing its way through her bones and into her veins. Suddenly, Theo's potion slowly begins taking effect, almost as if it were waiting for this grand entrance. Her fingers go fuzzy, and her head feels light. Her head turns toward Theo but the movement is slow, lapsed in time. When her eyes finally meet his, he appears to be in a state of culture shock, he is wide-eyed and slack-jawed, taking in the revelry and the overwhelming cacophony of noise.</p>

<p>She asks him a question and although her lips are moving, nothing breaks through the din. She resorts to shouting directly into his ear, “Are you alright?!”</p>

<p>He notices her then as if he's almost shocked that she's been standing there all this time. She forces her face to emit the same question without shouting, and he nods, then smiles.</p>

<p>“I'm fine! This-this is amazing Hermione” he shouts.</p>

<p>Something deep within her blooms. "C'mon, I want you to meet someone.” Hermione half drags Theo over the dance floor. It is sticky underfoot and everything smells of beer and sweat. They finally reach a corner of partygoers on maroon sofas marked with a VIP sign. She finds Jacob on one of the sofas, puffing smoke from a spliff. He notices her and furrows a brow before suddenly jumping to his feet and rushing over to greet her.</p>

<p>“Hermione! I almost didn't recognize you! You look hot!” Jacob exclaims while pulling her into a hug that sweeps her feet entirely off the floor, and bombards her with the smells of tobacco, pot, and orange spice.</p>

<p>“Thanks for inviting me, this is Theo, my friend!” Hermione tugs Theo a bit closer and he reaches out a hand to shake Jacobs. Jason only laughs in response and pats him playfully on the back shouting, “A friend of Hermione's is a friend of mine! Welcome!” He guides them up to his area behind the VIP marker and announces their presence to the array of gathered partygoers who all together provide a simultaneous “Wooot” in response before returning to their state of pounding fists to the beat of the music and swaying from side to side.</p>

<p>Hermione suddenly feels a hot rush of air in her ear and the warmth of a body directly behind her, “Here” Jacob's voice speaks closely into her ear and takes her hand in his, placing a small pill in her palm. She stares down at the yellow pill, etched on its surface is a smiley face. Hermione moves to pull away from him but Jacobs grabs her hip pulling her closer to him and leans down to speak directly into her ear again.</p>

<p>“One for your friend too.” He explains and drops an identical pill into her palm.</p>

<p>He finally releases his hold on her hip and she teeters toward her place next to Theo, whose gaze flits between her and Jacob with an air of curiosity. Ignoring his questioning gaze, she grabs his hand dropping one of the pills in his palm. For a moment they both stare at their respective tablets with the same type of uncertainty, until finally, they gather uniform courage, tip their heads back, and swallow. Emboldened by their guts and feverish from the frenzy surrounding them, they join in the dance of nameless, indulgent souls.</p>

<p>Time passes by until suddenly, something feels different. A burden she was unaware of is suddenly lifted. She feels lighter, and clarity washes over her. Something from deep within, usually guarded and ignored, surges to the forefront of her consciousness and is finally set free. Complete serenity and bliss envelop her. It had been suppressed by fear, dismissed as foolish, and deemed unimportant and useless. As it is liberated from the depths of her soul, she awakens. The ceaseless conflict between logic and emotion, the echoes of pain, the impatience of reason, and the paradox of rage and guilt dissolve into nothingness. Peace reigns supreme, cradling her. I love you, you are enough, it cries. Tears of joy, understanding, and acceptance stream down her face.</p>

<p>For too long she has been trapped in survival mode, bound by anticipation and fear. The damning voices eternally echoing: 'You are not magical enough. You are not smart enough. You are not wanted. You are not needed. You are always second. You are not strong enough, brave enough. Not enough of a student. Not enough of a friend. Never enough of a daughter. You are undeserving. You let them die. Let all of them die. Never deserving.' Are obliterated with the snap of the cord. Death's oppressive grip releases her, leaving behind only profound peace and bliss.</p>

<p>“I understand!” She exclaims.</p>

<p>Tears are welling up, bearing down on the floodgates of her vision.</p>

<p>“ I understand Theo. I— it's all going to be alright! Isn't it?”</p>

<p>“Everything is as it should be Hermione. We're free!” Is his ecstatic response.</p>

<p>“We're free!” She echoes.</p>

<p>The moment of hysteria, of perfection, cradles her. The reverb of the guitar suspends her spirit, shrouding her with euphoria. Her body sways to the music unbidden, it beckons to her to feel the moment—Open up. Let it be. Feel it!—it commands and she acquiesces. Guided by the beat, her hips sway instinctively, and her body relaxes, becoming loose and free like jelly, allowing her to be carried deeper into the sea of bliss. The moment stretches on and she begins to feel trickles of sweat snaking down her spine. She opens her eyes to find vibrant red and burnt oranges shrouding her vision. As the bombardment of senses heightens further, Her jaw begins to clench unbidden. Her every sense is slowed, and her consciousness is reduced to small and short bursts. The sounds of Laughter and hollers from the people surrounding her, equally bejeweled by the heightening guitar, go in and out of her awareness.</p>

<p>Without warning, she feels an arm wrap around her, its touch grazing the top of her head. She turns, her vision struggling to keep pace. A tousle of her hair and a kiss to her cheek are all she manages to register. By the time she pivots to catch a glimpse of the culprit, a server balancing a tray of empty glasses is already swiftly walking away.</p>

<p>“They said Happy Birthday! I told them it's your birthday Hermione!” The voice of Theo barrels into her ear. She finally notes his presence next to her, his eyes are wide, his pupils blown to the edges of his irises.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>"Hermione, they sang the entire song to you, and you just stood there like a muppet! I was genuinely concerned you might begin to drool!”</p>

<p>"Sorry, I just…Everything is happening so fast!"</p>

<p>"It's great, isn't it?” He responds half paying attention, his eyes dart around the massive space. Strobe lights etch his cheekbones, she can faintly make out the sweat trickling down his temple.</p>

<p>“Hermione! Hello?” He roars into her ear.</p>

<p>She gasps, “What Theo, I'm here!”</p>

<p>"No, you were just standing there again with that blank look on your face!”</p>

<p>Hermione moves, and somehow now finds herself in the loo. The mirror taunts a reflection in front of her and she leans toward it trying to piece the figure together. She doesn't look the same. What is happening? It's all too much— too fast, too loud….She looks up at her hair and there's a crown on her head, and across her body a banner reads ‘Birthday Girl'. When did this? How? She leans over the sink, splashing water onto her face. When she looks up into the mirror again, she feels too hot and overwhelmingly sticky. And her feet, they feel —wet. She looks back down to the sink and it is on— overflowing.</p>

<p>No no no. What is happening?</p>

<p>She takes out her wand, but her hand is now three. There are three hands and three wands. Everything begins to occur in slides. She's barefoot, outside, on the street, running. Someone calls her name. The wind is cool, a relief against her face.</p>

<p>Make it stop!</p>

<p>Suddenly she's sitting on the sidewalk a faint conversation is happening around her.</p>

<p>“My flat is just upstairs if you two want to stay.”</p>

<p>Hazily, she registers the voice as Jacob's.</p>

<p>“No, no I've got to get her back. She needs rest, some peace.”</p>

<p>Peace…</p>

<p>Something clicks in the back of her drug-raddled brain. Peace. She needs to go where peace is. Before she knows it she's running again.</p>

<p>“Damnit Hermione wait!” Theo's voice cries from behind.</p>

<p>She doesn't care, she needs to get to the infirmary, to peace. She prints her way down London streets, her bare feet scraping on trash and glass, but whatever is in her way is nothing. She needs to get Home.</p>

<p>A hand grabs her, “Hermione! Wait! I brought an antidote potion, I already took it a while back, when you started—never mind just take this.”</p>

<p>Theo shoves a vial in her hand and she teeters in place. Her hands shake as she raises it to her mouth, but obeying Theo, she downs the contents.</p>

<p>"I can apparate us to Diagon, then we can Floo to Hogsmeade, and finally, I'll apparate us to just beyond the Hogwarts wards. Just try to stay with me, Hermione. I'll get us there, I promise, but you have to stay with me.”</p>

<p>Her eyes feel heavy, aching to roll into the back of her head. Instead, she forces herself to nod compliantly.</p>

<p>"Take care of us, Theo. Please.” She begs.</p>

<p>Her ceaseless sweat is causing her clothes and hair to stick to her body and her skin is crawling by the time he takes her hand in his own. The pull of the apparition floors her, she heaves all over the floor of the Leaky. A few steps later they are in the fireplace and Hermione's vision blurs. She feels arms holding her upright through another twist and pull at the navel, she heaves again.</p>

<p>At some point she hears Theo's voice in her ear, “You need to see Madame Pomfrey— she'll know what to do.”</p>

<p>Unable to provide another nod, Hermione leans in closer to his side, allowing Theo to guide her. It is both ages and no time at all when they finally approach the wing of the infirmary. She begins to feel a bit better, she considers that the heaving probably helped, overall she finds herself relieved to be back at Hogwarts. Theo begins to push open the heavy door to the infirmary and suddenly jerks to a stop as muffled voices spill into the corridor.</p>

<p>“He's not well, been convulsing like that for hours. I am only good for generalized practice, he— he needs a specialist.” The unmistakable voice of Madame Promfrey is etched with urgency.</p>

<p>Hermione pushes against Theo, breaking herself free from his hold, and places her ear on the cracked door.</p>

<p>Another nameless voice breaks in, “He needs to be seen at St. Mungo's…”</p>

<p>“The top healers at St. Mungo's maintain the stance that they do not have the means to provide him care.”</p>

<p>Theo meets Hermione's gaze, mouthing “McGonagall?”. She nods hazily in reply.</p>

<p>“The MEANS? If Harry Potter was lying in that bed, Mungo would be sure to have him. But no, it is Draco Malfoy. The already dammed Death Eater. They are not fooling anyone with that ludicrous rhetoric. There is an institution in Moscow which deals with these exact cases, if you were to only grant him the—.”</p>

<p>“We cannot send him to Russia. He is under strict confines under the conservatorship of the  DMLE. As I previously said Mr. Gulch, I do not have the means to—.” McGonagall begins but is interrupted by the now identified, Mr. Gulch.</p>

<p>“Means means. There you are with the same baseless excuse. Again, to recapitulate my point as the Malfoy solicitor, the survival of my client is currently in the hands of the ministry, we must file for immediate termination of his probation, it is your job as HeadMaster to sign the petition, to ensure his survival!”</p>

<p>Questions bombard her thoughts…. Convulsing for hours? St. Mungo's refuse care? End his probation? Send him to Moscow?</p>

<p>Theo's brain seems to be as rattled as her own and he bursts through the doors. Hermione falls in after him, tripping on her unsteady legs, and landing on the ground. Still wearing her short muggle skirt, her knee scrapes against the stone, freeing more blood from her already ravaged wounds. Hermione lifts her head and meets the gaze of three bewildered spectators.</p>

<p>Madame Pomfrey rushes over and helps Hermione up to a standing position.</p>

<p>“Mr. Nott, whatever has happened to Ms. Granger?” McGonagall inquires sternly.</p>

<p>Theo replies to McGonagall's question, “She fell ill while we were out celebrating her eighteenth birthday. We decided she needed to come here to be examined…” Then turns his attention to Mr. Gulch asking, “What is this about Draco?”</p>

<p>Madame Pomfrey approaches Hermione, gingerly leading her to an empty hospital bed and peeling her hair back from her sweat-streaked face. “Are you okay dear?”</p>

<p>“I'm fine, I think. I may need something for the wounds, but I'm fine now. Feeling better, I heaved a bit ago and I think it helped.” Hermione supplies a small smile, something akin to silly me.</p>

<p>Madame Pomfrey nods and responds, “Yes, well dear try to relax, I'll go retrieve the dittany for these wounds. Your feet are in tatters, have you been strolling about on glass?”</p>

<p>Hermione disregards Madame Pomfrey and strains her ears to eavesdrop on the conversation unfolding between Theo and Mr. Gulch.</p>

<p>"What exactly are you planning to do with Draco?” Theo presses.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulch waves his hand apathetically.</p>

<p>“None of your concern son, go on now.” He drones.</p>

<p>“Hermione dear.” Hermione turns toward the concerned voice and is slightly surprised to find Madame Pomfrey still remaining at her bedside.</p>

<p>“Hm?” Hermione replies.</p>

<p>“Your pupils, dear. They are quite dilated. Do you need a calming draught?”</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that would be fine, please," she acquiesces, eager to get Pomfrey moving along.</p>

<p>To Hermione's relief, Madame Pomfrey complies and shuffles away, leaving a clear view of the discussion at hand. Mr. Gulch regards Theo, dressed in baggy muggle pants and a scrappy tee, and gives a disparaging curl of his lip. Unruffled by such blatant distaste, Theodore continues to probe him.</p>

<p>“I am his best friend, the only one in contact with his mother, I think I should know.”</p>

<p>“And I represent the Malfoy name.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gulch turns toward the exit, thoroughly dismissing Theo. This does nothing to hamper Theo's urgency as he calls after him.</p>

<p>“Narcissa does not have a solicitor!”</p>

<p>With his back to Theo, Mr. Gulch slows his pace and lifts a finger in the air, “Under Wizarding Representation law Rule 56(b), ‘A solicitor must maintain protections..'”</p>

<p>Theodore pauses his onslaught, shifting to a conversation with himself. "I know it wasn't Narcissa... But then who..."</p>

<p>“…On client confidentiality, forbidden to indicate to or divulge the identity of…”, Mr Gulch continues.</p>

<p>Theo's eyes suddenly widen in comprehension, and when he speaks, it is only above a whisper.</p>

<p>“Lucius hired you.”</p>

<p>Abruptly, Mr. Gulch spins on his heel, his robes billowing around him in a tight swirl. His eyes narrow to slits.</p>

<p>“Again, I am not at liberty to discuss the matters of my client, let alone with a small child.”</p>

<p>“A child? I am his best friend! And the only responsible individual Narcissa Malfoy has entrusted to obtain knowledge about what is currently happening with her son!” Theo bellows.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulch openly scrutinizes Theo's tattered state and sends a brief glance toward Hermione.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes. Responsible. What a choice of words.” His brazen spit of disapproval is apparent, "Now I must be off. Us adults, have important matters to attend to, unlike you children who are better off heeding your professor's orders.”</p>

<p>With another swish of his robes, he clears through the open doors of the infirmary, leaving the room in a state of tense stillness. The silence is broken by the sounds of a creaking bed. Theo and Hermione both turn their attention toward the corner of the room Malfoy occupies. He's convulsing.</p>

<p>Hermione's heart drops into her stomach. She rushes over to him, ignoring the pain in her feet and legs, In the same moment Pomfrey re-enters the room.</p>

<p>“Hermione, get back into bed! You're Streaking blood all over the floor!” She calls.</p>

<p>“What, what happened? Why aren't you helping him?” She feels a fit of hysteria winding up her spine. How long has he been like this? Why haven't they done anything to help him?</p>

<p>“We've tried everything, Ms. Granger. He's not responsive. This has been occurring off and on for several hours. We were just discussing the private matter before you two came in.” McGonagall confesses. Behind the small frame of her spectacles, she eyes Hermione curiously.</p>

<p>Hermione doesn't care that she appears ridiculous, let alone what Mcgonagall or Pomfret thinks. She leans over Malfoy in an attempt to still him with her hands alone, but his body is jerking violently under her grasp. His jaw is clenched, and his chin protrudes outward causing the veins in his neck to strain from the effort. She notices then, The necklace. He's not wearing it.</p>

<p>“The necklace…” Hermione mumbles.</p>

<p>“What necklace?” Madame Pomfrey inquires.</p>

<p>“The stone—The necklace Malfoy was wearing! Where is it?” She demands.</p>

<p>Madame Pomfrey registers Hermione's inquiry and points to the bedside table, “I needed to tidy him up, so I put it in the drawer with his other belongings."</p>

<p>Hermione rushes to the side table, rips open the drawer, and snags the necklace from within. A sobering feeling washes over her at its touch, causing her body to quiver, and the stone pulses faintly in response. Returning to the side of his bed, she gingerly lifts Malfoy's head, tucks the necklace behind his neck, and promptly closes the clasp.</p>

<p>She waits a few moments, hopeful and eager for the stone's magic to take effect, but he continues convulsing. Hermione leans down and places a hand on his cheek.</p>

<p>“Malfoy it's alright, Your mother's necklace is here. Nott is here, we're all here. You are safe, everything is okay.” She murmurs soothingly.</p>

<p>At the sound of her voice, he relaxes and his head lulls into the palm of her hand. The entire infirmary is silent and still. She waits a few moments for his breathing to even out, before rising to her feet and turning around. Everyone's eyes are focused on her in silent wonderment.</p>

<p>“He needed that necklace. It must remain on his person. Do not take it off in the future.” She orders.</p>

<p>"Of course, My apologies Hermione… I wasn't aware…” Pomfrey stutters, at a loss for words.</p>

<p>Headmaster McGonagall steps forward, breaking through the tension in the room. Belatedly, Hermione realizes how rude she must have sounded, ordering Madame Pomfrey around, and she had been completely unaware of her tone… She slinks back to the nearby bed she was occupying, feeling mortified.</p>

<p>“I think it's time you all go to bed, it is well past curfew. Mr. Nott, please return to your dormitory. Ms. Granger,” McGonagall sends Hermione a stern look, “You will sleep here tonight. Take the potions Madame Pomfrey gave you and please, get some rest.”</p>

<p>Hermione nods and watches as they all slowly depart. She lies in bed for only a few moments until she is dragged under by sleep.</p>

<p>Hermione stands in a dark room, mist swirls around her, completely obscuring the ground underfoot. In the room with her is a table holding a small wooden box. She eyes the box suspiciously, and every few moments it pulses—light pouring through its closed hinges. Pounding startles her, and rips her attention from the box. She turns toward the sound and notices a door. It is rattling, someone from beyond is pounding it fiercely. She approaches the door and notices it is firmly shut with no handle to open it. Tentatively, she places an ear against the frame and a muffled voice cajoles, “Where are you…little Mudblood…”</p>

<p>Hermione immediately jerks back, retreating to safety at the center of the room. Her breath catches in her lungs as her heart pounds its way up her throat. A faint flutter of light garners her attention, and when she returns her gaze to the box, the pulsing light is stronger, blinding her. Without properly thinking, she advances toward the box, although still eying it suspiciously. It seems to speak to her— open, open, open, —it demands and she's helpless to refute its commands. She opens it. A brilliant ray of white light bursts forth. The screaming behind the door becomes frenzied. When the ray finally dims, she peers at the contents within and her eyes find a compass. The needle spins hectically in every direction. She watches as the needle spins and spins until finally, it stops with a resounding pop. A floodgate of light pours forth, completely blinding her.</p>

<p>Hermione awakens.</p>

<p>She sits up in bed, beads of sweat trickle down her breasts and back. She discovers she is completely soaked. Letting out a heavy sigh, she slicks her hair back from her face, pulling it into a tight bun. Her head is pounding and her eyes feel scorched.</p>

<p>It was only a dream.</p>

<p>Rising from the bed, she swipes the glass of water off the side table, downing it desperately. She feels delirious, and oh, so tired. She roughly rubs at her eyes, trying to rid the searing pain. When she opens them, she notices a faint light emitting through the darkness of the infirmary. She strains her eyes to focus on where it's source is and her gaze leads her to Malfoy's bed.</p>

<p>Tugging the dressing gown off the end of her bed, she pads toward him. When she reaches Malfoy, she fathoms that the strange spring of light is emitting from the stone on his necklace. Seating herself at the edge of the bed, she lifts the gem from its place on Malfoy's chest, eyeing it curiously. The black abyss remains, but a swirl of fulgent white light dances around in its depths. She draws closer, inspecting the phenomenon with wonder. The swirl of light quickens, and it dances frantically across the stone, until abruptly, it vanishes, returning the surface of the gemstone to it's original state of inky blackness.</p>

<p>She lets out a labored breath, and reaches down to place the gem back on Malfoy's chest when, without warning, a hand plants itself firmly around her own. She gasps. She knows that hand. She knows those long, pale fingers. Her heart hammers in her chest, her veins are thrumming with heavy foreboding. When she finally looks up, two familiar granite eyes are locked onto her own.</p>

            <h2>The Abyss</h2>
            <div>
                <p><em>Before— it was only darkness.</em></p>
<p>Draco pondered whether it was the end.</p>
<p>And so, like a wayward soul lost in a foreign land, he boarded the runaway train of his thoughts and began his journey through the seven stages of grief.</p>

<h4>Shock:</h4>
<p>Initially, he had been confounded when he considered his current predicament was, in fact, death.</p>
<p>For Draco, death at such a time was affiliated with unsavory sentiments, such as defeat and failure. It was not the concept of death that was most upsetting, but the reality of who he was when it had claimed him. There was no redemption for Draco Malfoy. He had left no impact on the world— other than being a soldier on the wrong side of a war. A loser in a losing war.</p>
<p>He couldn't be dead.</p>
<p>It was unfair.</p>

<h4>Denial:</h4>
<p>Surely death couldn't have come for him so soon. There had been no fulfillment to his existence, no crescendo leading to his final resolution. Finally, there had been the opportunity to take charge of his life, to follow his path, and form his future, but then he just— died. Draco held onto adamance as if it were the last thing left in the world for him to cling to, which it was.</p>
<p>He could not be dead.</p>
<p>This could not be happening.</p>

<h4>Anger:</h4>
<p>He survived a war for Salazar's sake. A war that had not claimed him in any sort of respectable death. No, he had escaped war unscathed. However, life, it seemed, had decided it was not finished mocking him. First, he had to be humiliated— had to be stripped of his family, dragged before the public, and forced to cower on his knees and admit guilt. Only then, once he was finally on a path in the right direction, did he die.</p>
<p>That was the luck of Draco Malfoy; that was his legacy.</p>
<p>This is how he would be remembered: Draco Malfoy, a feeble and witless sheep, unable to make his own decisions, shape his own path, and follow his own desires.</p>
<p>Son of disgraced Lucius Malfoy, protege to the crazed Bellatrix Lestrange, pawn to The Dark Lord, Voldemort. He was a mindless tool to them all and he would be remembered as such.</p>
<p>Fuck Father.</p>
<p>Fuck Aunt Bella.</p>
<p>Fuck Voldemort.</p>
<p>Fuck Death.</p>

<h4>Bargaining:</h4>
<p>He waited, but nothing happened. Death, he thought, was rather unremarkable. There was only Draco and his thoughts.</p>
<p>Unless… it wasn't death.</p>
<p>What if he were somehow alive?</p>
<p>How could he decipher death from life?</p>
<p>He strained to listen for the softest of sounds. Squinted into the unending dark for the faintest hint of light, but his efforts were futile… Darkness was a captor, robbing him of all his senses, mocking him.</p>
<p>Though he prodded himself, even if it were death, would not something, eventually, have to happen?</p>
<p>He waited patiently for a great realization to strike him, or for enlightenment to suddenly dawn — but his waiting was again, fruitless…</p>
<p>There was no dramatic reliving of his life or his memories. No great wonder emerged from the ether to spirit him away. It was only Draco and the incessant void.</p>
<p>There was nothing more to do, except to stew in the murky depths, so that is precisely what he did.</p>
<p>He continued telling himself that, something was bound to happen if he were to wait only a little while longer. He resolved himself to this premise, he had to, otherwise— he didn't like to think about the other option.</p>
<p>Insanity ran in the Black bloodline. He had seen it with Aunt Bella and had heard about the unraveling of Sirius in Azkaban. Regulus, he was certain, was en route to demise before his disappearance. Growing up, his mother was tactful and deliberate in her efforts to avoid all topics concerning her childhood, staunchly skirting around any mention of Aunt Walburga. Early on, he had learned that, although understanding his lineage was a crucial requirement of being of Black and Malfoy ancestry; delving any deeper than the surface was considered imprudent.</p>
<p>The draw was conclusive in Draco's mind— all the other little Draco's sitting at the round table agreed, that pondering death was much more palatable than contemplating insanity. Draco couldn't go insane, it was inconceivable. They all nodded in tandem. Draco and the little ones huddled in thought, how could they tell death from life?</p>

<h4>Testing:</h4>
<p>There must be some indicator of the afterlife beyond death, darkness, and emptiness.</p>
<p>“Light!” one particularly handsome Draco at the round table shouted.</p>
<p>He had heard tales wherein people who had died, came back to life, claiming to have seen a light on the other side. He recalled that when he first heard the tales, he thought them bizarre, that the revived dead had consistently spoken of a light. This seemed questionable, a strange case of ad populum if you asked the Draco's at the table. Like a beacon it would guide the souls of the dead toward— he wasn't exactly certain toward what end, but the light, he did recall that particular detail being significant.</p>
<p>If the light were an indicator of death then Draco should wait for it, shouldn't he?</p>
<p>So he waited for the light. They waited.</p>

<h4>Depression:</h4>
<p>The light did not come. It would not come. The round table was empty now, he was completely alone. Draco curled himself into a ball and gave up.</p>
<p>He was Draco Malfoy; he was a terrible person, wasn't he? Hadn't he done terrible things, in the name of…evil?</p>
<p>He was undeserving. Unclean.</p>

<h4>Acceptance:</h4>
<p>Draco adopted death.</p>
<p>The darkness became his sole companion, the only witness to his mediocre end.</p>
<p>He was dead.</p>
<p>His time… had ended.</p>
<p>And he resolved that it was befitting: he was Draco Malfoy…the light would not come.</p>

<p>Until… It did.</p>

<h4>Present:</h4>
<p>Like a distant land that suddenly emerges on the horizon of a vast and endless sea, light materializes in the abyss.</p>
<p>It is faint, not brilliant nor striking, no, it is only a wisp. Despite its faintness, it twirls and dances in the distance, intrepidly weaving its way through the abyss. It is stationary for not one moment, behaving as a hummingbird that flits rapidly from flower to flower.</p>
<p>As it draws nearer, his senses are roused, the rays pulse and vibrate through him, seeping into his skin with the same warmth once offered by the sun. After so long detained in darkness, he basks in the presence of light and warmth, he is desperate.</p>
<p>With the light, comes a voice, it is slightly dampened by the darkness— muffled as if spoken through a body of water. He realizes that it is a woman's voice, and she is speaking not in English, but in Latin.</p>
<p>An incantation.</p>
<p>If the light is warmth, then her voice is fire.</p>
<p>Every word she speaks ignites his spirit, filling him with a vitality he has not experienced since he first came to this place. Every lingering vowel wraps around him like he is a coddled babe.</p>
<p><em>I am alive.</em></p>
<p>It is the first time he has dared to truly believe the prospect; that he is alive, that this is not the end of the path, maybe something near to it, but not death itself. The woman's dulcet voice floats toward and it is sweet, like the taste of chocolate after being in the presence of a dementor.</p>
<p>It is melodious, soothing. An angel?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Something in the far reaches of his mind tells him that he knows this voice, but he can't quite place it. It is perplexing. The familiarity of it wracks his brain. There is something about the tone—uneasiness, hesitancy, fear—-which makes it impossible to place—as if he had never matched this voice with such despondency.</p>
<p>Then, as soon as it had come, the voice suddenly ceases.</p>
<p>To Draco's relief, the light remains. It is fainter now but remains steadfast in illuminating the darkness.</p>
<p>Time drifts onwards, and Draco waits, he watches as the light flickers and dances around him, staving off the darkness like a Patronus.</p>
<p>It could be minutes… days… years…</p>
<p>He doesn't know how long he waits, when suddenly the light sparks anew, thrumming and pulsing like an excited dog at the return of its master. And when the voice of its master does return, it is clear as day.</p>
<p><em>Granger.</em></p>
<p>Granger is speaking to him. He's never been quite so elated to hear Granger's voice.</p>
<p>But why her? Of all people? As always, she's rambling on about some nonsense, but Draco chooses not to listen. He shouts, screams, tries anything and everything to gather her attention.</p>
<p>There is no answer.</p>
<p>Is she aware that he cannot respond? It's maddening, listening to her needle on about organizing her books using his— his body?</p>
<p>Absolutely not, when I get my hands on that bloody witch…</p>
<p>But then the silence returns and he's left to wait alone for unknown moments, until her voice breaks through the void again, and this time, he listens.</p>
<p>It is better to listen than to be alone in darkness.</p>
<p>She calls him a prat. Of course, she does. She goes on about short-branch and long-chain runes, and he wants to explain that, unfortunately for her, she is wrong. There is a text— a text belonging to him, which in fascinating detail, explores the magical significance between the two Rune systems. Particularly, how the Elder Futhark is the prevailing option in regards to defensive charms and protective enchantments, whereas the Younger Futhark is notably suited for divination and brewing. He wants to rub in her face that, yes, his tomb is indeed, a first edition, and no, she's not to borrow it.</p>
<p>Consumed by his thought, he belatedly realizes that she has trailed off, and appears to be speaking to someone else. He strains to listen, hopeful to hear any voice other than Granger's, but hers is the only sound that penetrates through the darkness.</p>
<p>With nothing else to do, he eavesdrops on the conversation, hopeful for any hint regarding his current situation… Where he is…. Where they might be. She appears to be speaking to the red sheila.</p>
<p>What's her name? Ginevra? What a horrid name.</p>
<p>Hermione has just been accused of dallying with his body.</p>
<p>Hah, serves her right.</p>
<p>She says he's “half-dead”.</p>
<p>Wonderful. So I'm not Dead, only half-dead.</p>
<p>She's proving to be rather unhelpful. Today is her birthday. It's September 19th.</p>
<p>How the fuck do I know Hermione Granger's Birthday?</p>
<p>Then he wonders why the fuck Hermione Granger is going to a muggle club for her birthday. She's Hermione Granger for Salazar's sake. She's probably better off staying in the castle, reading or something of the sort. She might as well read to him while she's at it, relieve him from his boredom.</p>
<p>And then, she's gone again.</p>
<p>He wishes he could make her stay, he can't bear being left alone for so long in the darkness. Waiting for her has become a habit, the only thing he can do. At this point, he is unsure what he would do without her.</p>
<p>Her voice is like air. It awakens his senses, reminding him, you are alive. It's the only thing that tethers him to existence beyond this dark abyss. He waits… it could be minutes, hours, or days. He doesn't know and can't tell. As always, it is only him, darkness, and that faint constant wisp of light.</p>
<p>Then out of nowhere, the wisp falters and is devoured completely by the darkness.</p>
<p><em>No, no, no. It can't be.</em></p>
<p>Draco scrambles for the light, ripping and tearing at the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>NO. NO. NO.</strong></p>
<p>He gnashes and screams, he can't be left here all alone, again.</p>
<p>Draco loses his control, and he rampages.</p>
<p>For hours, he rages. Anger, terror, and panic overtake him, and propel him towards utter mania.</p>
<p>Insanity is nothing compared to this. This isolation, this hopelessness.</p>
<p>It is worse than defeat and he is certain—worse than death. Death is declarative, an end. But wherever he is, is only a pocket, a chasm between the solid ground of life and death. He could be lost here, forever, with nothing— no one to help him. He had Granger, had light, but he just let them go. Draco remembers what it feels like to cry.</p>
<p>As soon as it had departed, the wisp bounds toward him. It presents itself primly as if it had not just deserted him and left him alone to fend for himself.</p>
<p>Hermione has returned as well. Her voice fills the empty void with familiar warmth and Draco clings to the sound. She's speaking, but he doesn't have the energy to make out the words. All he can focus on is the sense of relief that he feels, the consolation of having company. Of not being alone…</p>
<p><em>Please, stay.</em> He begs.</p>
<p>He is utterly pathetic, If only Father could see him now. Begging… her…</p>
<p>But this time, as her voice recedes, the warmth of her presence lingers. It's a subtle distinction, but Draco's experiences have taught him to recognize true solitude. Nowadays, he knows loneliness like the back of his hand, and this... is not it. Breathing echoes through the darkness, and Draco focuses on the measured cadence— matching his breath with hers. Then there is the unmistakable sound of a snore. She's asleep. He commits her breathing to memory, captivated by the slow inhales and gentle exhales until they turn into labored whimpers and desperate cries. She must be having a nightmare. When he first arrived in this place, he had nightmares too. However, since the wisp of light arrived, his nightmares have become few and far between. Draco ponders whether the wisp would help her, too.</p>
<p>Draco urges it on… <em>Go to her</em>, he tells it.</p>
<p><strong>He commands it.</strong></p>
<p>The light flickers in response, before bounding in the direction from whence it had come. He waits, this time, less manically so.</p>
<p>When it returns, it is in full force, blinding him with a brilliance he has not yet encountered. He reaches out his hand to grasp it. And his entire world shifts and tilts.</p>
<p>There's a tug on his mind, similar to the pull of apparition. It squeezes him, compresses him, and barrels him through a tunnel as thin as a keyhole. Then suddenly he can feel. It's his hand. It is wrapped around warmth. Fingers...</p>
<p>He opens his eyes. And it is her. She is real. He is real.</p>
<p><strong>He is awake.</strong></p>
<p>But as soon as his eyes meet her brown ones, she falls limp across his lap. Her hips are balanced on the edge of the bed, her chest is sprawled across his legs and midsection, her head is nestled against his chest and her cheek lies flush against his heart.</p>
<p>For moments, he is motionless, struck with shock and disbelief. When he finally regains the sense to analyze his surroundings, he notices he's in the infirmary and on one of the small sick beds.</p>
<p>The place is dark and devoid of any other company. He registers the familiar blue hue of moonlight filtering through the windows and projecting onto the stone floor. It is night.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, Draco peers down at the motionless girl sprawled across his lap.</p>
<p>Hermione's hair falls in ringlets across her face and over the white bed sheets. He is unsure whether she had fainted or if somehow, his awakening sent her into her own deep slumber.</p>
<p>He attempts to push her off of him, but it is useless, he can't move. Draco tries to wiggle his toes but sorting out the jumbled nerves and muscles appears to be futile. They are tangled and filled with sand, making the finest of movements practically impossible. Finally, he surrenders warring with his limbs, and allows his brain and body to slowly acclimate to being alive again—to being back in his body.</p>
<p>He tries to make sense of the situation. It suddenly becomes apparent that he has been unconscious all this time. He tries to speak, but only an aphasic croak leaves his lips. Darting his tongue onto his lips, he tries to reduce some of the dryness in his throat, but his tongue is like sandpaper, and somehow makes it worse.</p>
<p>He searches for his hand among the mass of jumbled sensations he finds it still grasped firmly around Hermione's. Her grip is tightly clenched around the end of the chain that adorns his neck. A Necklace? He doesn't wear necklaces…</p>
<p>The situation is all a bit much, far too intimate for comfort. He concentrates on releasing his hold on her hand, and slowly, finger by finger, succeeds in freeing it. A sense of triumph washes over him, then quickly vanishes when his hand falls and lands limply on her head.</p>
<p><strong>Great.</strong></p>
<p>Draco is already aware that he doesn't have the strength to lift it back up, so instead focuses his efforts on moving his fingers. He coaxes one to move, it twitches slightly over the brown curls trapped beneath. It's disconcerting; having his abilities reduced to fine and pitiful movements. Before, he had been healthy, full of vitality, and now, lifting a single finger reduces him to exhaustion.</p>
<p>Draco's focus is intense. Sweat trickles down his brow, and his hand jerks and shakes as he exerts all his might to move his finger. <em>Come on</em>, he tells it. All of his attention is focused on one thick curl, and at last, he manages to twirl it around his finger. It's quite an achievement, albeit, a bit pathetic. Disregarding his thoughts, he persists in delicately stroking her head, her hair is softer than he had expected. Gradually, the sensation returns to multiple fingers, and the gentle strokes transform into slow, deliberate combing. His ministrations part her hair from her face and expose her expression, which is serene in her state of slumber.</p>
<p>He pauses, staring down at the woman's head resting against his chest. It's difficult to fathom, that he is stroking Granger's hair. Although, it doesn't appear to disturb her—Soft breaths continue to trickle from her mouth and the rays of moonlight illuminate her olive skin. Draco takes her in. She looks a mess, worse than what is considered typical of the witch.</p>
<p>Hermione always appears slightly disheveled. Not that she is ragged or unkempt, but her dishevelment is akin to being a bit chaotic or tousled, as a person. It's almost as if her appearance reflects the turbulent state of her mind— her brain is seldom quiet. Draco knows this, for years he had heard it whirring from across the Great Hall, in class, and even in the stands of the Quidditch Pitch. When she isn't prattling, the swot is lost in thought, and her appearance has long taken the toll of her neuroticism.</p>
<p>In earlier years, it was her hair, it had stood on end as if she had been in a perpetual state of electrocution. However, as time and years passed, the frizzy mess seemed to tame a bit. Now they are dark brown ringlets that cascade past her shoulders and bounce down her back each time she regimentally marches down the corridor. Instead of projecting through her hair, her disarray is now etched on her face. When they were young, her expressions had been bold and audacious, brimming with the vivacity she was once known for. However, her expression has since changed, and he doesn't know her well enough to decipher it.</p>
<p>Her brow is slightly furrowed, and without thought, he smooths his thumb over it.</p>
<p><em>Better.</em></p>
<p>Having to gaze at such an expression is unappealing, that is all.</p>
<p>His eyes move to her eyes. Her eyelashes are coated in dried goop and inky black streaks stain beneath her eyes. Draco swipes his finger under one eye, transferring sludge onto the pad of his thumb.</p>
<p><em>Makeup? Since when does Granger wear makeup?</em></p>
<p>Being in his weakened state, having limited movements, and nothing else to do, Draco uses the pad of his thumb to clean the mess.</p>
<p>Leave it to Granger to forgo washing up before sleep.</p>
<p>Eventually, his hand grows tired and weak. With the activity having drained him, and unable to conjure any other movements to shift her off of him, he lays his head down onto his pillow and accepts the current state of affairs: Hermione Granger is lying over him, asleep. The thought of it is indecent. He has never allowed anyone to sprawl over him like this, not even Pansy in 6th year. But of all people, here she is. Hermione Granger rests over his heart, breathing peacefully. He can't ignore the fact that her breath is pleasing; he knows it now, he's synched his own with its cadence, it is comfort. Draco allows his hand to relax, and this time, it rests on her cheek. He closes his eyes and joins in the circuit.</p>
<p><em>One, two, inhale, three four, exhale.</em></p>
<p>Their breaths fuse in concert as he drifts back to sleep.</p>

            <h2>A Guide to Poorly Devised Schemes </h2>
            <div>
                <p>A rouge autumnal breeze, arid and biting sweeps through the open window and into Theo and Malfoy's shared dormitory. Parchments loosen from a stack where they lay sloppily across Theo's desk and take flight like a group of first years on their inaugural day of Flight Class, scattering aimlessly across the room. Hermione lounges back on Malfoy's abandoned bed, idly watching as one stray parchment flies overhead and brushes against the drapes of the canopy which flitter, and sway— bathing the ceiling in emerald hues. Of course Malfoy would keep the green. The thought of him causes her thoughts to wander, and the memory replays in her mind, for what feels like the millionth time. It haunts her every waking hour, and even now, two weeks later, continues to monopolize her life.</p>
                <p>It was but one blink— one moment spent in the dimly lit infirmary, where she was consumed by shock and disbelief, debilitated by Malfoy's firm grip on her hand and the intensity of his gaze, and then the veil of darkness overtook her and she was dragged off to sleep. When she woke the following morning, it was to the blinding rays of the morning sun— the intensity of which pierced through the white curtains, seemingly intent on gouging her eyes out. She groaned at having to pull herself back to reality, the previous night's sleep was the most restful she had in ages, probably because of the drugs—which regretfully, is not the most disconcerting realization she would have that morning.</p>
                <p>Coming to her senses, the frustration she had felt toward the unwarranted brightness was quickly replaced with mortification—by the awareness of where she was, and who she was lying with. She had slept sprawled across Malfoy's chest, her hand wrapped tightly around his own, her legs twisted and entangled around his like a pretzel. Horrified, she lifted her head to move away, but found it heavier than usual, and quickly discovered that Malfoy's hand had been a firm weight upon her cheek. She wondered confusedly how it had gotten there, how she had gotten there. When the recollection of the night's events eventually flooded back to her, she quickly extricated herself from their entanglement and promptly rushed off to find Madame Pomfrey, eager to bear the good news—sans details of the post facto cuddling.</p>
                <p>The report of Draco's miraculous awakening spread through the castle quickly; whispers morphed into outright gossip which was soon heralded throughout the Great Hall and around every corridor. Hoards of students rushed to the infirmary, everyone desperate to roll away the stone— to see for themselves. When Pomfrey, McGonagall, and several ministry personnel including Harry, burst through the infirmary doors, they came to face with Malfoy lying in his usual spot—still and dormant as ever.</p>
                <p>Pomfrey had evaluated Malfoy twice, then a third time at Hermione's pesky insistence. When at last she threw in the towel, she turned to Hermione with a resigned countenance declaring in a form tone, “There is no evidence to suggest he woke. I'm afraid you were only sleepwalking dear.”</p>
                <p>Sleepwalking. What utter rubbish.</p>
                <p>The wave hit her head on, it swept her off her feet and plunged her into the frigid waters of humiliation. Hermione, who had willingly marched towards the altar of war, who sacrificed her childhood for what she believed in— regardless of the stakes and despite the Wizarding world's cowardice and acquiescence to passivity—found that the integrity of her word, her truth, had been reduced to mere sleepwalking.</p>
                <p>For hours after, she stood over Malfoy's bed and held a strange silent vigil, watching him closely. She felt the threads of her sanity unwinding, pooling onto the hard stone beneath her feet. A fanatic voice in the back of her mind warned her that if she tore her eyes away, even for a moment, he would undoubtedly use the chance to stir again. So Hermione stood by and waited. Eventually, desperation took a toll, and she resorted to firing insults which produced nothing. She pulled the fine blonde locks on his head, pinched his porcelain skin, and began shaking him ruthlessly. She was bent upon waking him again. She could not, would not leave until he stirred. She needed proof—proof that his unconsciousness was a farce, proof that she was not mad. The abuse lasted until Madame Pomfrey finally had enough of it and expelled her from the infirmary.</p>
                <p>By then, no one had believed her. Hermione expected as much. She wasn't exactly the portrait of mental soundness. Her incessant poking and prodding had left red welts snaking up Malfoy's arms, neck and cheeks. Banishment from the infirmary, however, was short-lived when she pleaded with Madame Pomfrey, promising that she wouldn't lay another hand on him. She would only wait and watch. The days passed slowly and uneventfully. She missed meals and classes. Homework was piling up. Ginny, Harry, and Theo grew increasingly concerned, so with sour reluctance, she left.</p>
                <p>Her daily visits morphed into check-ins multiple times a day, which in turn, led to her spending a few hours studying by his bedside, like she had done on her birthday. No one questions why she still goes, but she does. Throughout her life, she has been dubbed as stubborn, relentless, and determined, and these qualities have never failed her, so she continues to cling to her adamance with a tenacious grip.</p>
                <p>"I'm not mad. But I'm not daft either, I know what they're saying about me… “Hermione's gone bonkers”... I couldn't care less about what everyone thinks or says…” She scoffs as she lounges on Malfoy's bed, her legs crossed at the ankles, her hands clasped over her stomach, idly twiddling her fingers. She continues addressing the ceiling,  “But, Theo…. it was all too real and I can't stop thinking about It… I saw him with my own eyes, I felt his hand on my own…”</p>
                <p>There's no response, just the rustling of papers and clinking of glass. Hermione turns her head toward Theodore, curious to see if he's even listening, and of course, he's not.</p>
                <p>Theo is rummaging through his bedside table, murmuring mindlessly to himself. His brown hair is tousled as if it's unable to decipher whether it prefers to be worn in curls, gentle waves, or straight like a blade of straw. His robes are of similar fortune, giving the impression that he had whisked them from the floor by blindfold, which is not unlikely, considering the current state of his room. She has been a guest of the space often enough to know that the disorder is less of a transient state but rather a declaration, an “artistic choice”. He furnishes this ever-transforming mosaic made of sweet wrappers and soiled laundry by flinging empty vials and sheets of parchment over his shoulder.</p>
                <p>Dodging a vial aimed at her head, she continues speaking, her voice raised slightly, “It has been weeks, Theodore. I know that he's in there, we just need to figure out what roused him that night. I have a theory that it was the necklace, but I'm afraid if remove it again…”</p>
                <p>Theo kicks the side of his nightstand and the drawer slams shut with a thud.</p>
                <p>“Fuck! I'm all out of potion again!”</p>
                <p>Hermione sits up and moves to the edge of the bed. Theo roughly rakes his hand through his hair, tousling it further before bending over the side table, his knuckles growing white as he tightly grips the edges of the stand. His hair obscures his expression, but a bead of sweat falls and crashes against the mahogany wood.</p>
                <p>Hermione clears her throat, “Theodore, how much have you been taking?”</p>
                <p>“I just need something.” He murmurs, mostly to himself.</p>
                <p>When he turns his face toward her, she can see the agony written across it. He is white as a sheet, his brows are furrowed, lips are pinched, sweat is accumulating on his forehead.</p>
                <p>“Alright, alright. I have a few more tablets. I think they may help a bit.”</p>
                <p>Hermione retrieves her bag from the foot of Malfoy's bed and reaches her arm in. Inch by inch, the limb vanishes into the depths of the bag until only her shoulder is visible. There are faint sounds of clunking and clattering until finally, she extricates her arm with a battered pill bottle in tow. She unfastens the topper, walks over to Theo, and hands it over.</p>
                <p>Theo lifts the bottle to his lips and Hermione watches as two tumble into his open mouth. He swallows them down with a sip of tea from a cup which has been a resident on the bedside table since her visit the previous evening. Theo rolls the bottle in his palm eying the contents and the worn label.</p>
                <p>“Hermione, there are only four left in here.” He notes.</p>
                <p>“Yes, I know… I need to refill the prescription… I was planning on popping into London on Saturday. I need to pick up the post from home too.”</p>
                <p>Theo's eyes widen, he peers down at the pill bottle in his hand then back at Hermione with a concerned expression, “Hermione why hadn't you said anything? I wouldn't have taken them, let alone two if I had known… There are four left and it's only Monday.”</p>
                <p>Hermione rolls her eyes, “Why are you looking at me like that? I'll be fine…”</p>
                <p>Theo sighs and leans over to open the bedside drawer, which he had earlier beaten into submission. The wood creeks tiredly as it opens and Theo begins shifting around the contents within.</p>
                <p>“I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken them from you…I know how it feels to…. I can't control it sometimes…” He breaks off, pausing in his sorting through the drawers.</p>
                <p>Tension hangs in the air between them, a quiet animosity unfamiliar to her, like a standoff between two wild dogs. They were starved and lonely souls, adrift in a sea of turmoil and somehow drawn to one another by the same current. They have braced the waves together, rocking and bobbing, sharing what they could. But what would happen if there was no more bounty? Who would get the last piece of meat?</p>
                <p>Hermione shudders, and Theo appears to be on the same train of thought, he reverts back to his rummaging through the drawer and begins rambling loudly, “I— I need to brew… I have the ingredients, just haven't the time, plus I get so shaky when I go too long without…Hold on a minute..”</p>
                <p>His rummaging through the drawer grows more rampant. The sound of glass clinking and papers shuffling echoes through the room.</p>
                <p>“Where is it?” He mutters.</p>
                <p>Hermione leaves the bed to stand at his side, “Where is what?”</p>
                <p>“The draught!” He cries. Hermione takes a step back at the abrupt and shrill proclamation.</p>
                <p>“What draught?”</p>
                <p>Theo rubs his hands roughly over his face and grunts in frustration, “The draught I brewed… I made it when I was low on Wormwood, I thought I could substitute the Asphodel instead. I was very wrong… I tested it on some fourth-year's Pygmy puff, and it was rendered unconscious almost instantly… I unintentionally created—”</p>
                <p>“Draught of the Living Death…” Hermione supplies.</p>
                <p>“Yes… At least some variation of it… My test subject was a Pygmy Puff, so I'm not exactly sure what it would have done to an actual person. When I realized what I created, I marked it with an X and placed it in here…” he gestures to the side table with a dramatic wave, “But as you can tell, it's not here.”</p>
                <p>“And what makes you think it isn't littered on the floor among the mess?” She gestures to the clutter littering said floor.</p>
                <p>“It was in the drawer. I placed it here weeks ago, I haven't touched it since.”</p>
                <p>“Well, maybe you were mistaken? You had been stressed Theodore, you are stressed. Try to relax, the medication should be working soon…”</p>
                <p>He rubs a hand over his face, nods resignedly, and falls back down onto his bed. Her bottle of pills sits next to him on the mattress, and he picks it up, “Right, here Hermione... Again.. sorry about..”</p>
                <p>He doesn't finish his sentence, only hands it back to her, then places his elbows on his knees to cup his face in his palms. She makes her way back to Malfoy's bed where her bag is, and reaches for it, intending to place it back inside, but pauses. Hermione unfastens the lid and peers down at the last few pills tumbling around at the base. She skipped her last dosage and it's been nearly half a day since she's had one. Her hand twitches. The urge to tip the bottle, to allow one pill to drop from the rim, slip into the open palm of her hand is— no. She will not be tempted. She has four left… Her brain tolls the bells: Distraction! Change of course! Ready the sails!</p>
                <p>“How about Dinner, Theo? I'm famished. Let's pop into the Great Hall, I overheard the elves earlier, apparently mutton is on the menu.”</p>
                <p>From his station across the room, Theo looks up from his palms and his body produces a violent shiver, “Eugh. Gross, Hermione. You cannot be serious, mutton is foul.”</p>
                <p>“Hush, I'm sure we can find something for your refined palate— maybe a dish of butter, and a bit of salt.”</p>
                <p>They make their way down the winding stairs toward the Great Hall, Theo lagging a tad behind as the pills undoubtedly begin to kick in, and Hermione trudges on, determinedly ignoring the errant thoughts of how comfortable he must be feeling by now. She turns a corner and spies the familiar hue of short, wild black hair and the unmistakable sight of round lopsided spectacles.</p>
                <p>“Harry!”</p>
                <p>She rushes over to him but halts a few paces away, taking in the sight. His robes are pristinely pressed, silver embellishments adorning the collar, with the ministry seal proudly etched across his breast. In one hand, he carries a leather briefcase, while the other clutches a scroll.</p>
                <p>“Well, well… I suppose it's ‘Mr. Potter' now. You look quite… spiffy.”</p>
                <p>Harry grunts and squirms uncomfortably. “I hate them… Creature is insistent on robbing me of all my rights, and he's the Elf. I can't do my own laundry, pick my own clothes—obviously, Ron is having a field day, never having laundered a day in his life, but I can't stand it. Usually, I roll down the hill by the black lake or do some jumping jacks to loosen them a bit before I make an appearance.”</p>
                <p>“And why today of all days warranted such an exhibition. Are you here to investigate?”</p>
                <p>“No, not today. I was the ministry-elected representative for a meeting. AKA, "no one wants to do it, so we'll send Harry".”</p>
                <p>“Ah, I see. Well, I don't see how a meeting with McGonagall would warrant such attire.”</p>
                <p>"Yeah, well, it wasn't just her. Madame Pomfrey and a Mr. Gulch were also present... Matters concerning Malfoy... I can't exactly divulge all the details due to confidentiality and Section V of Article 42, stipulating why children shouldn't be representing the Ministry, blah, blah, blah..."</p>
                <p>Hermione suppresses a laugh with the back of her hand, “Oh, so I see you have met Mr. Gulch.”</p>
                <p>"No wonder no one else fancied the job. I've seen more civility in a Blast-Ended Skrewt. I'm just relieved it's over with; now he's Russia's problem.”</p>
                <p>“Russ—?” Hermione intends to question him but is abruptly interrupted by Theo who has finally caught up to them.</p>
                <p>“Hey, Harry. Nice robes. Creature seems to be taking care of you well enough.” He says cheerily.</p>
                <p>“How do you know Creature prepared my robes?” Harry probes concernedly.</p>
                <p>“I'm certain I've seen a portrait of Orion Black wearing that same set. I recognize the Black motif right there.” Theo gestures to the silver embellishments on Harry's collar.</p>
                <p>There is a loud smack, and Hermione looks down to see Harry's pristine briefcase on the stone floor. When she looks back up at him, he's already stripping off the outer robes while grumbling curses under his breath.</p>
                <p>“Harry, where are they now? Mcgonagall and Mr. Gulch?” She inquires.</p>
                <p>Theo crinkles his nose, “Mr. Gulch is here, again?”</p>
                <p>Harry tosses the robes into a dusty corner and sighs as if he's just freed himself from shackles, “Yeah. They were making their way to the infirmary, though, you didn't hear it from me. And hey, Theo, Sorry about Malfoy, I know he's your mate. The whole situation is bonkers. Madame Pomfrey conducted some thorough tests, I saw her report. There are no signs of internal bleeding, and according to her, his brain seems intact. It's as if he's in some kind of distended state of sleep…”</p>
                <p>Harry furrows his brow in thought, but his concentration is quickly relayed by the sound of approaching footsteps and voices from around the corner. They all turn towards the commotion to find Ginny and Dean Thomas. At the sight of Harry, Ginny pauses. The smile on her face fades, morphing into a cold and distant expression. She whispers something to Dean and they both turn back around, swiftly exiting in the same direction they had come. Harry swallows, his gaze lingering on the vacant hall long after they've disappeared.</p>
                <p>Hermione interposes, “Hey, Harry. We're off to grab some dinner, would you like to join us?”</p>
                <p>At her inquiry, Harry breaks his focus on the empty corridor. “Oh, Erm, Thanks, but No. I have to head back to the ministry, I'm supposed to reach out to the Headmaster of Koldovstoretz—“</p>
                <p>“Koldovstoretz? As in the Wizarding school in Russia? Whatever for?” Theo cuts in.</p>
                <p>Harry scrunches his face and rubs at his neck, “It's well… Shit. I probably shouldn't have let that slip…” He lets out a labored sigh and meets Theo's questioning gaze, “Theo, you should probably go and see Malfoy… He won't be here much longer.”</p>
                <p>Hermione and Theo exchange a glance, not deigning to spare Harry a goodbye before tearing their way down the corridor, toward the infirmary. When the towering wooden doors loom into view, Hermione doesn't slow down, she only flicks her wand at them, causing them to swing open in a swift motion. The hinges groan and emit a loud whine before booming against the stone interior. Their gallant entrance draws the attention of three familiar faces, all of whom seem thoroughly unamused by their sudden appearance.</p>
                <p>A quiet conversation dissipates between McGonagall and Mr. Gulch while Madame Pomfrey, stationed at the far end of the room by Malfoy's bed, spares them only a fleeting glance before returning her focus to folding bandages and arranging vials into a black leather briefcase. Hermione narrows her eyes at the sight of it. Mr. Gulch, in particular, appears thoroughly displeased by their presence and casts an overt sneer in their direction. He's clad in a shiny metallic silver suit which does the most to highlight the greasy sparse strands of hair on his head, his visage exclaims: sneaky, slimy, corrupt.</p>
                <p>“What is going on?” Hermione inquires, nodding toward the bag in Pomfrey's arms.</p>
                <p>The ensuing silence sweeps over the room and lingers a bit too long. But Hermione doesn't miss the covert glances shared between the three.</p>
                <p>At last, Mcgonagall deigns to respond, “We are preparing Mr. Malfoy for his journey to Russia.”</p>
                <p>“Russia?” Theo blurts.</p>
                <p>“Yes, he has been released from probation and has the Ministry's clearance for travel to Russia for treatment. He is set to travel in the coming days via International Floo.”. Her lips are a thin line projecting a look of no-nonsense, but Hermione disregards it.</p>
                <p>"You must be joking! Malfoy's condition is far too delicate for travel, especially by Floo! There are far too many risks involved. He's already at risk of prolonged unconsciousness, Floo travel could exacerbate his condition. There's no telling how it could affect him! It could trigger seizures or cause brain damage, who knows what Floo travel might do to someone in his state!”</p>
                <p>Madame Pomfrey attempts to assuage Hermione's ranting, “Ms. Granger.. We understand your concerns, but he must get to the healers in Russia. We have clearance for his transfer and they expect his arrival within the next coming days…”</p>
                <p>“But surely there must be something you can do! Malfoy should be here, in England! Near his mother, with his friends… Surrounded by people who know him… who…care for him…” She trails off, her gaze flits between McGonagall and Madame Pomfrey, whose expressions appear unmoved by her appeals.</p>
                <p>Mr. Gulch releases a labored snort, addressing her haughtily, “I do not fully comprehend how any of this is your concern, child, but alas, you have no input in these matters. Everything is set for Mr. Malfoy to be transferred this evening, by Floo.”</p>
                <p>"Train." The word is murmured gently, almost imperceptibly.</p>
                <p>Everyone turns to the fragile voice and finds Theo, gazing absentmindedly at Malfoy's figure in the bed.</p>
                <p>“What was that dear?” Madame Pomfrey questions.</p>
                <p>Theo turns to the three, firm determination is etched on his features.</p>
                <p>“He can travel by train. Hermione is right, Floo carries inherent risks. He could board the Hogwarts Express that will take him to Platform 9 ¾  at King's Cross station, and I —I will assist in transferring him to the train bound for Warsaw. The expense is of little consequence." </p>
                <p>"I cannot defy my client's specific request, let alone from hearsay by none other than a schoolboy." Mr. Gulch erupts, his voice booming with indignation.</p>
                <p>Spittle escapes his mouth in his outrage, arcing through the air in tiny droplets like the end of a misty hose. Hermione takes a deliberate step backward. However, Theo remains undeterred; he draws closer to the man and glowers at him, “Then tell him. Inform Lucius of what is at stake."</p>
                <p>Mr. Gulch flinches, visibly shrinking a few centimeters into himself at the mention of his client.</p>
                <p>Theo, however, appears to grow a bit taller and plows forward, “Unless... You'd prefer to explain to Lucius upon Draco's arrival in Moscow, why his son's brain is mashed to a pulp… I've corresponded with Narcissa; she understands the gravity of her son's situation, and I shan't hesitate to inform her of your disregard for the hazards involved in this transfer.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Gulch stews over Theo's words, his expression shifting from aggravation to indignation, and finally to blatant apprehension.</p>
                <p>"I will speak with my client and voice these concerns. However, if he accepts the stipulations presented, we will not be considering someone so inept for the responsibility of an escort. A hired detail will be present at Platform 9 ¾ to ensure his delivery to Moscow. This will be done with no contest and only if and when my client agrees.” He makes a disturbing sound, somewhere between the bray of a donkey and the screech of a bat. It's hideous.</p>
                <p>He appears to realize he let the noise slip and turns to Madame Pomfrey and Professor McGonagall with a somewhat collected countenance “Might there be somewhere where we can speak with more privacy? I'm afraid the unending disturbances have grown tedious.”</p>
                <p>“Certainly Mr.Gulch we can speak in my office.”</p>
                <p>Professor McGonagall turns to Madame Pomfrey “Are you free to join us? We will try to keep the meeting brief.”</p>
                <p>“I'm all done here for the time being. I have no issues comin' along.” Pomfrey replies.</p>
                <p>They move to leave, but McGonagall pauses and calls after them, “Madame Pomfrey, could you kindly show Mr. Gulch to my office? I will be along shortly.”</p>
                <p>Mr. Gulch manages a final sneer before trailing after Madame Pomfrey out of the infirmary. As McGonagall approaches them, Hermione notes the weariness etched across the Headmaster's features; wrinkles and creases carve her face like battle scars. She had read a book the summer before fifth year, a detailed account of World War II, quipped with real photos, there was one she found particularly jarring, it depicted a soldier on the day he was dispatched to the front lines, and then on the day of his return. She remembers sitting on the dining room floor, staring at the two photos, her gaze flitting between the bright-eyed man before the war and the hallow-looking man after. Hermione doesn't need a photo to recognize the changes in McGonagall. There is a depth in her eyes, that hadn't been there before, that which can only be acquired through the first-hand experience of witnessing suffering and death. The feature imperceptible to most is familiar to Hermione, she sees it often, in the gaze of strangers wandering Diagon Alley, on the eyes of her friends, and in the reflection in the mirror.</p>
                <p>“Theodore, Hermione. I am aware of how committed you both are to Mr. Malfoy's recovery,  which is heartwarming and somewhat surprising, particularly in your case, Hermione. However, I urge both of you to consider that sending him to Russia may be the most prudent option. Koldovstoretz specializes in magical healing, the school possesses an entire wing dedicated to exploring magical maladies of every sort, with resources far surpassing that which even St. Mungo's could offer. Apart from receiving superior care, he would also be a free man. The Russia Magical Ministry was not associated with the war and has no intention of enforcing probation or restrictions upon him. Before the incident, I had spoken to Mr. Malfoy and he expressed his desire to leave Britain, to start anew with a clean slate. I believe this opportunity is precisely what he had hoped for. I implore you to consider my points and contemplate what Mr. Malfoy would truly want in this situation.”</p>
                <p>With that, McGonagall tips her head in a small farewell and departs the infirmary. Hermione waits until she hears the door to the infirmary click shut before turning to Theo. His face is blank and expressionless while he stares fixedly at the closed doors. Hermione shifts on her feet, grappling with what to say. What can she say? His best friend is being sent off the Russia and there is nothing they can do. Perhaps—perhaps there is nothing they should do.</p>
                <p>Theo turns swiftly and strides over to Malfoy's bedside and stares down at him. Silence reigns for several minutes before he finally speaks, “The draught.”</p>
                <p>Hermione cocks her head, attempting to make sense of what he might be saying. “The draught..?”</p>
                <p>Theo whips his head in her direction and repeats himself, louder this time, “The Draught, Hermione!”</p>
                <p>She shakes her head, still perplexed at his nonsensical blabbering.</p>
                <p>“He took the draught! The one I brewed! He must have found it! Perhaps having mistaken it for one of my euphoria elixirs… Harry said there is no evidence of traumatic injury, his brain is intact. He even likened the condition to that of a state of distended sleep! It makes sense! We can help him! We can fix this!” A twinge of hysteria lines his tone.</p>
                <p>“Theodore, that's… Well, it's a breakthrough. We should inform Madame Pomfrey. Let them know how they can help him.”</p>
                <p>“He doesn't have to go to Russia!” He exclaims.</p>
                <p>Theo's positively beaming, the twinkle in his eyes is bright and filled with hope. Hermione feels her heart practically snap in two because McGonagall is right, Malfoy must go to Russia. It is what's best, for him...</p>
                <p>“Theodore… That's wonderful news. Malfoy is so lucky to have you as a friend— his best friend… quite possibly, his only friend…” Her attempt at commiseration feels a tad overdone.</p>
                <p>She plows onward, “But in all honestly, I think McGonagall is right… Russia could be a blessing in surprise. He would have amnesty there, and could live somewhat peacefully; without being recognized as a war criminal. He would have access to treatment, far better than St. Mungos, who wouldn't even take him.. and he'd have the time and opportunity to assimilate back to everyday life. He's been unconscious so long, its probably better this way. He will get the help he needs. …”</p>
                <p>Theo shakes his head determinedly, “But we now know how to help him, he doesn't have to go.”</p>
                <p>“Theodore, please just stop and think… Think about him.. About what is best for Draco.”</p>
                <p>Theodore pauses, having never heard Hermione use his given name. She swallows continuing, “If it was the draught of living death he would need a Bezoar. How about you focus on obtaining one? Inform Madame Pomfrey and McGonagall…Fix things as best you can, in the ways you can.”</p>
                <p>“Fix things as best I can, in the ways I can,” he repeats softly. He stares down at the floor for a few moments in contemplation before speaking again, this time in better spirits, “Yeah, you're right, Hermione. I think… I think I could manage to acquire a Bezoar… Actually, I need to go and get on it now. I'll see you later alright?”</p>
                <p>He stands up straight and nods passively in farewell, muttering to himself under his breath as he hastily exits the infirmary. Relief floods her; convincing Theo had been an easier task than she thought it would be. She shoulders her bag, intending to follow, but something urges her to peek over her shoulder. Malfoy lies peacefully in the small bed, the serene backdrop of the Hogwarts grounds painted behind him. She contemplates how this might be the last time she will see him like this, and possibly the last time she'll ever see him. If Russia truly allows him to have a better life, he may never return. Hermione walks over to his bedside and drops onto the chair beside it. Maybe she should stay and read, just for a while.</p>
                <p>Sighing from boredom, Hermione drags her finger along the dusty air vent and gathers a thick layer of grime onto the pad of her forefinger. With passive abandon, she rubs the chalky residue between her thumb and forefinger, the friction of which causes dust particles to escape into the stuffy interior of the car. Her eyes grow itchy and watery from irritation, and she leans down to wipe off the remnants of the grime onto the side of the upholstered driver's seat before desperately seeking the leaver to roll down the window. Stagnant and brooding, the dust coats the entirety of the car, inside and out. An unwelcome reminder of how long the car has been sitting idle and unused in the garage of her parent's home. It has been over a year now, since the start and the end of everything…</p>
                <p>She churns the leaver incessantly, but the action only produces tired groans to issue from somewhere inside the door. Finally, the window gives way and lowers with heavy reluctance, allowing fresh and cold air to flood the car and nip at her bare arms. She had removed her coat ages ago, being trapped in the vehicle for what feels like ages. In her prolonged waiting, he even had time to read an entire book. Albeit, it was only The Metamorphosis, but still…</p>
                <p>Searching for another distraction, she peers out the window, at the endless swarms of rushing London urbanites, going to and fro with what seems like meaningless abandon. They're ignorance of the events of the past year allows them to do so. They were concealed from the war that had raged to secure their freedom, protected from what could have befallen if Voldemort had won. She can't help the sour taste in her mouth. The anger she harbors toward muggles, wizards, everyone…herself.</p>
                <p>She frowns.</p>
                <p>She glances again at the beaded bag sitting in the passenger seat. With her prescription refilled, she has nothing stopping her from taking a few and abating the heavy emotions of being here; in her parent's old car, forced to watch the scurrying about of normal people living their normal and untainted lives. No, she tells herself firmly. Tonight, when she's alone in her room, she will unfasten the cap and down a few. Then, she will finally rest and let everything go.</p>
                <p>Hermione pulls herself upright in the driver's seat and clutches the steering wheel with white knuckles. Her knee begins bouncing irritably and she drums her finger on the leather wheel.</p>
                <p>Where is he?</p>
                <p>She should have known better than to believe Theodore when he claimed he'd be done by five. It's ten past six, and he's yet to show face. However, part of her knows she can't be too upset with him, this marks the last time he will be seeing his friend for who knows how long… She supposes that he deserves to take as much time as he needs.</p>
                <p>Theodore's plans had come to fruition: Malfoy is to be delivered to Russia by train. Word had come earlier in the week that on Friday, October 11th, Malfoy would board the Hogwarts Express bound for Platform 9 ¾ at King's Cross Station. From there, a hired escort would accompany him by a combination of rail and car to Koldovstoretz in Russia.</p>
                <p>Everything had worked out. So when Theo approached her, asking her to meet him at King's Cross, she hadn't questioned him; she simply agreed. Everything was finally righting itself: Theo could stop worrying, Malfoy would get the help he needed, and Hermione could finally be free of his presence, and therefore, no longer find herself at his bedside or contemplating that one fateful night.</p>
                <p>She ponders how they might spend the rest of the evening. It's Friday, after all, and there's no need to return to Hogwarts. She'd like to explore London a bit; perhaps she'll show him Oxford Street, or check out the nightlife in Camden, he'd probably like the scene there—artistic and chaotic, much like him. She muses on whether he's ever seen Buckingham Palace, but abandons that thought; the crowds there are simply dreadful, and royalty doesn't strike her as Theo's taste. If he wants to see a castle, he only needs to head home.</p>
                <p>She eases her head back onto the headrest, resigned to wait a while longer, and still contemplating on where she should take Theo, when pounding on the back window startles her. Turning in her seat, she glimpses Theodore pressed firmly against the glass, one hand lying cupped against it as he attempts to look in, while the other pounds on it erratically. Theodore can be so impatient at times…</p>
                <p>Hermione rolls down the passenger side window and calls out to him, “Theodore, the passenger seat is upfront, just pull the handle.”</p>
                <p>It's either that he does not hear her or has deliberately chosen not to listen. He only continues his pounding on the back window, all the while whining desperately, “Open up! How do you get this bloody door to open? Hermione!” He continues pumping the side of his fist against the glass like a toddler throwing a wobbly, “Help me, hurry!”</p>
                <p>Hermione unbuckles her seatbelt and stretches over the center compartment to reach the passenger side. The console is digging into her ribs as she stretches over it, reaching for the handle. All the while, Theo's relentless pounding on the window continues. Her head feels like it is going to implode from all the clamor. Finally, she grasps the handle and uses the tips of her fingers to push the door open from within. As she looks up from her uncomfortable position across the seats, she intends to harp at Theo for his ineptitude in failing to complete such a simple task—but the words catch in her throat. She shrieks.</p>
                <p>Theodore is leaning against the back door of the car, panting heavily and dripping in sweat. This is not the issue, the issue is that he is not alone. His grip is firmly clasped around the handle of a wheelchair, and sitting in the chair, wearing a muggle hospital gown, donned in overlarge sunglasses, and wearing a silver wig on his head, is Malfoy.</p>
                <p>“Oh my… Merlin Theo, what in Goodrich's bloody name are you doing—with him!?”</p>
                <p>“I'm fixing things, Hermione, like you said.”</p>
                <p>Hermione wrenches open her door and rushes around the back. Her gaze darts around frantically, searching for the Aurors who are inevitability on their way to retrieve Malfoy. She expects helicopters and military-grade vehicles speeding down the street, or whatever the equivalent would be for wizards, possibly fire breathing dragons, or the sudden apparition of forty Aurors, wands at the ready.</p>
                <p>How could he do this? What was he thinking?</p>
                <p>Hermione internally slaps herself for not expecting something like this from Theo. The plonker breeds chaos. As she rounds the car, Theo is in the midst of unloading Malfoy, who is still seated in the wheelchair, into the backseat. Malfoy's face collides with a stack of her books and creases a few of the pages. She has the mind to throttle Theodore, but is waylaid by the sudden blare of a sire. In her panic, she shoves Theo aside, leaves Malfoy sprawled face-down across the length of the back seat, and hastily moves to shut the car door. However, something is in the way, and it refuses to close. The siren grows louder until finally, an ambulance rounds the corner and speeds off in another direction. She clutches at her heart, gasping from the stress of it all.</p>
                <p>Then, narrowing her eyes, she points her finger at Theo. “You!”</p>
                <p>Hermione attempts to slam the door again, but it bounds back towards her.“Ugh— Heedless…”</p>
                <p>She tries again, this time pressing her back against it, “Of all the … Fuck! Why won't it close?”</p>
                <p>She rounds on Theo, expectantly.</p>
                <p>He swallows, “Well, his leg is hanging out.” He gestures to the leg dangling from between the car door.</p>
                <p>“Oh.” Hermione reaches down and shoves the stray leg into the car. Limbs are everywhere, Malfoy is so large, and the car is far too small to have him lying prone. She performs a wordless Jelly Legs Jinx and folds Malfoy's legs into the car with ease.</p>
                <p>She releases a triumphant harrumph and slams the door shut. “There.”</p>
                <p>When she turns to face Theo again, his eyes are wide with fear.</p>
                <p>That's right, I'll have no problem folding you into the trunk. They are still in public, but she's feeling rather crazed at the present moment. She points her wand at Theo in broad daylight and steps forward until he is pressed against the side of the car.</p>
                <p>"What are we supposed to do with him?" She demands, the tip of her wand digging into his ribs.</p>
                <p>Theo raises his hands in surrender. “Hermione, I just needed to get him out of there… We can work something out.” He stutters.</p>
                <p>“Theodore, I am completely baffled as to what in the world could make you think this as a good idea, but I am telling you right now, it is a terrible one. They'll come looking for him! They will find us, drag him to Russia and then us, to — to Azkaban! We have to send him back.”</p>
                <p>Theo lowers his hands and gives her a pleading look. “Hermione, there is no turning back. I'm already on thin ice with the ministry, I wouldn't be able to talk my way out of this.”</p>
                <p>“I can't believe this is happening.” She sighs and pulls her wand from between his ribs, sheathing it back into her pocket.</p>
                <p>“So you'll help me?”</p>
                <p>“Just get in the car."</p>
                <p>With Malfoy tucked in the back seat, Hermione and Theo hastily clamber into their own. Their doors slam shut simultaneously and the vibration dislodges a layer of grime from the dashboard, allowing a cloud of dust to mushroom into the air. Her eyes grow itchy again, but she takes no risks in opening the window, and instead, turns the key.</p>
                <p>Click. Click. Click.</p>
                <p>Hermione slaps the dashboard as the battery strains to start. “Come on, come on….” She urges.</p>
                <p>Finally, the engine obeys and rumbles to a start. She slams her foot on the accelerator and speeds off, far from King's Cross Station.</p>
                <p>For several minutes they sit in silence as Hermione winds her way through the thin streets of London, hoping to lose anyone who might be trailing them. When they reach the motorway, the old car jerks and sputters straining to acclimate to the speed of the highway. There are several honks and muted explanations as cars veer around to pass them. Finally, they reach an acceptable cruising speed and she relaxes her shoulders ever so slightly.</p>
                <p>“Alright, explain.” She demands. Her hands are gripped tightly on the steering wheel, her gaze focused on the road, although every moment or so she peeks at the rear-view mirror, expecting a military envoy to appear behind them.</p>
                <p>“I… Well, I covered our tracks… No one is after him, so you can relax.”</p>
                <p>“Hah! Relax… No Theodore. I said explain or I am pulling the car over and you can deal with whatever mess you've put yourself in, the mess you put us in!”</p>
                <p>She is shaking now, her blood is thrumming, the fine hairs on her arms and legs stand on end— electrified, eagerly anticipating a release of unbridled magic.</p>
                <p>“I swapped him out, alright!” Theo blurts.</p>
                <p>She rips her gaze from the road and stares at him. Theo's concentration is directed ahead like a staunch soldier.</p>
                <p>“I went to a muggle hospital… And… Well, there were only two choices, really. Only two blondes in the whole of London who are currently comatose, I chose the male of course… He was almost the same height, identical features, except for the weight which was a few tons over the mark, it actually was quite a feat getting him out, his size and all—”</p>
                <p>Hermione slams her foot on the brake pedal, causing Theo to fly forward against the dash. His head collides with the dusty surface, while Malfoy's own thumps against the back door.</p>
                <p>“You kidnapped a muggle! And you what? Swapped him out with Malfoy?”</p>
                <p>“Yes.”</p>
                <p>“Hah! And you think they wouldn't notice. That the ministry would not be able to tell the difference—.”</p>
                <p>“They were a hired escort! Completely separate from the ministry. Sent from Russia to be exact. They don't know what Draco Malfoy looks like. All they know is that he's male, blonde, and in a coma, nothing else. No one will ever question…” he argues.</p>
                <p>She slams her foot on the brake pad again and Theo's head collides with the dashboard for the second time.</p>
                <p>“Fuck!”</p>
                <p>Several cars honk and swerve past her, sending her a few two-finger salutes and one middle finger. She honks back.</p>
                <p>Fuck them, fuck this!</p>
                <p>“Okay…Okay..” She says, trying to calm herself “ I'll get the whole story later but I really can't bear to hear any more of it at the moment. What I need to know is what your plan is.”</p>
                <p>“I— I haven't thought ahead that far.” He mutters.</p>
                <p>Theodore Nott is not best skewered, broiled, or sliced. No, he needs to be charred to dust— and Hermione Granger wields an excellent Incendio. She takes a deep breath. It's all she can do at the moment.</p>
                <p>She grits her teeth, “Where am I to take you to?”</p>
                <p>“Is there anywhere we can hide him for the time being? Somewhere muggle. Somewhere no one can find him. Just until I can figure something out.”</p>
                <p>Hermione does not answer. Instead, she turns on her signal and exits the motorway. She heads to the only place left to go; the one place she dreads to visit. Hermione heads home.</p>
                <p>The lock refuses to click free, so Hermione whispers a wandless Alohamora, and the door swings open wide, and is sent crashing against the wall. A bang echoes through the silent and still house. She hates coming here. Hates it, hates it. Hermione grinds her teeth and looks back at Theo, who is pushing Malfoy, seated in the wobbly wheelchair, up the cobblestone path. She takes a deep inhale through her nose and doesn't allow herself to think.</p>
                <p>She learned two major items from her year spent on the run: the first being that there is productive thought and there is fretful thought, and it is best not to allow the latter to consume the former. The second is to choose her company wisely, a lesson it seems she has yet to fully implement.</p>
                <p>Once over the threshold and out of view from prying eyes, Theo swishes his wand, lifting Draco up and out of the wheelchair. And just like that, Draco Malfoy is levitated through her childhood home. Theo slightly lowers his wand and hovers Malfoy over the sofa and then onto it. And there he goes, onto the sofa she had Obliviated her parents on. It seems that nothing truly remains sacred. Hermione leans against the wall in the entranceway, electing to have no part in Theo's plans.</p>
                <p>Theo regards her spot against the wall, “I didn't have a choice, Hermione…I couldn't have him be sent off like that.”</p>
                <p>She erupts, “Yes, yes you could have! You could have done precisely that! Nothing! It is perfectly alright to sometimes do precisely that- nothing! Malfoy could have had a chance, and now—now he has nothing! You've only dammed him further! Have you even thought this through? What's going to happen? We need to go back to Hogwarts, and what will he do? Just sit here and rot while we're away? You're going to leave and come back to a carcass! This cannot work, he's in a coma! He needs medical care!” Finally, she breaks off, breathless.</p>
                <p>“He will wake…” He gives her a look that she can only describe as brazen naivety and pulls out a lump of something from his pocket. She realizes belatedly that it's a Bezoar. “I'm going to fix this.” He declares.</p>
                <p>Hermione scoffs from her spot on the wall. He eyes her position again, ostensibly misinterpreting her reluctance to assist, for hesitancy.</p>
                <p>“It will work, there's no need to worry.” He announces.</p>
                <p>“I'm not worried, I'm infuriated!” She huffs.</p>
                <p>“Oh. Alright. Well, I suppose I'll just be on with it then.”</p>
                <p>“Alright, on with it then.” She repeats snappishly, folding her arms over her chest. She will not be dragged into this.</p>
                <p>He kneels next to the couch, takes the Bezoar in one hand, and uses his other to pry open Malfoy's mouth. Hermione watches in horror as he attempts to jam the entire Bezoar into Malfoy's open jaw.</p>
                <p>Hermione pushes off of the wall and strides toward him, “Are you mad? You cannot shove it in like that Theodore!” She yelps.</p>
                <p>Theo has the sense to look abashed. “It appears I may need some help then,” he mutters.</p>
                <p>Hermione rolls her eyes, seats a partial hip onto the couch by Draco's side and roughly scoots herself closer, so as not to fall off. She leans over and takes his jaw in hand.</p>
                <p>“I'll keep his mouth open, all you need to do is chip at the Bezoar so that the powder can drop in. He should need about half that size, I don't know how you were able to acquire a Bezoar so large, it's enormous.”</p>
                <p>“There are a few goats at Nott Manor, specifically kept to produce Bezoars. I suppose this particular Bezoar had gone too long without removal. The goat was quite portly.”</p>
                <p>Hermione ignores him. She shifts closer to Malfoy, and using her fingers, pries his mandible in an open position. Theo follows her lead and begins the task of using his wand to pepper small flakes from the mass and into Malfoy's open mouth. Hermione disregards the prickle of stubble under her fingers and even uses her other hand to wipe some of the powder that lands on his nose and cheeks. It's quite strange that she has become so comfortable in handling him like this. Before, she had been repulsed by the mere thought of touching him, but now, here she is, tending to him like a nurse.</p>
                <p>She surprises herself with that train of thought. No. He is not her patient, and she certainly, is not his nurse. Amid her distracting thoughts, she misses that first imperceptible twitch of his jaw under her grasp. Though, the second time it happens, she does register it. She hovers above him, wondering if she had actually felt him stir. The Bezoar is halfway gone, most of it coating the interior of his mouth. She has Theo stop grating the mass, it's enough, she tells him. Theo gets up and moves to store away the remaining Bezoar. With the newly freed space, Hermione inches closer to Malfoy. She shuts his jaw and rubs the side of it in an attempt to manually force a swallow. With light pressure, she compels the movement by trailing her hand up his jaw, to his ear, and down the side of his throat. She is about to halt her efforts when she feels his throat move under her hand. When she looks up to his face Draco's eyes shoot open and lock onto her own. His gaze is fevered and panicked.</p>
                <p>He sucks air in loudly, in a ragged gasp. Hermione moves to pull away but his hand shoots up and traps her own where it is positioned on his throat. He squeezes it tightly molding it to his skin.</p>
                <p>Theo attempts to console Malfoy, “Draco! You're alright! You're awake, we have you!”</p>
                <p>Again, Hermione tries to peel her hand away, but it's a fruitless task, Draco's hand is locked firmly around her own. Without warning his other hand snakes to the back of her head, grips her hair, and pulls her down to him, pinning her head to his chest. His body is stiff as a board as Hermione squirms. She hits him with her free arm, in an attempt to break free, but his muscles secure her in place against him. She struggles for air.</p>
                <p>Theo pulls at his arm in an attempt to pry her free, “Draco! Calm down, let her go, you're alright! She's here to help!”</p>
                <p>Malfoy does not relent. Hermione is imprisoned above him, her hand is squeezed mercilessly underneath his, and her neck is twisted, contouring her head to his chest. She can feel his heart pounding erratically against her ear and the pendant pulses hot against her cheek.</p>
                <p>“Malfoy, let me go!” She squeals, her voice muffled against his chest, “Theo, please help! I can't breathe. He's suffocating me!”</p>
                <p>At this, Draco releases his hold on her head, but his grip around her hand remains firm. In one swift movement, she tears her head from his chest and with her free hand, strikes him across the face. His head whips to the side, and the loud crack of the slap echoes through the room.</p>
                <p>When he turns his head to look at her again, his eyes lack the frenzied panic that had shone in them moments prior. Now, they are only filled with shock. He gradually loosens his grip around her hand and releases her. Hermione snatches back her hand and cradles it to her chest. She wants to flee: rip open the front door, dash down the street, and run far away from him. But just as she moves to rise, he suddenly speaks, his eyes never diverting from her own.</p>
                <p>“Stay, please. Don't leave me alone again.” he croaks, his voice raspy from disuse.</p>
                <p>The effort of speaking sends him into a coughing fit, causing clouds of remnant Bezoar powder to puff from his mouth. Moved by pity, she defies her instinct to run and scoots closer. She tucks an arm around his back and props his head up. Theo joins, and together they heave Malfoy into an upright position on the sofa. They prop his body up with several dusty pillows and finally, his coughing ceases.</p>
                <p>Theo takes a knee next to the sofa, which allows Hermione the opportunity to rise and find refuge behind a chair on the other side of the room, far from Malfoy's reach. She stands behind it, her hand gripped firmly on the top of it, trying to sort her thoughts. Moments ago she had been ready to flee, but what he said, had halted her… What could he have meant by that? “Don't leave me alone, again.”. Hermione is pondering this until suddenly, Theo is at her side and pulling her out of the room. They brush through the butler door and into the kitchen. And stops them, he places his hands on her shoulders, “Are you alright?” He asks concernedly.</p>
                <p>Hermione stares down at a button on his shirt and nods, “Yeah, just a bit shaken. That was…”</p>
                <p>“That was entirely uncalled for, I'm so sorry, Hermione. Fuck.” he removes his hand from its place resting on her shoulders and rakes through his hair, pulling at the strands. “I'm so sorry. You were right, I didn't think anything through, I mean…. I didn't think he'd go ballistic like that! Are you sure you're okay?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, yeah. I'm fine Theo. I'll be alright. I think he was frightened, I shouldn't have been seated so close…” she trails off.</p>
                <p>“What did he mean?” The question pulls her from her daze and she meets his scrutinizing eyes.</p>
                <p>She attempts a feeble attempt at feigning ignorance, “What's that?”</p>
                <p>Theo raises a brow, “He asked you not to leave him alone….Again…” Theo clarifies.</p>
                <p>Hermione swallows before admitting, “I have no clue, Theodore.”</p>
                <p>Eventually, Theo makes his way out of the kitchen to check on Malfoy, leaving Hermione seated at the kitchen table. Her fingers shake as she trails them along the wooden surface. She doesn't want to go back into the sitting room, she doesn't want to see Malfoy, ever again. The whole ordeal was terrifying, and traumatizing. She breathes deeply. Inhale, one two, Exhale, One two. She repeats it, allowing her breath to guide her mind somewhere safe. A creak brings her from her focus and she looks up.</p>
                <p>“He wants to speak with you,” Theo says.</p>
                <p>Hermione breathes in another deep breath before nodding and rising. She allows her feet to lead her on the all too familiar path into the sitting room.</p>
                <p>The route that led her to the presents tucked underneath the tree on Christmas morning, the path that delivered her to her father quietly reading in his chair, the path she had taken when she cast a spell that altered her life. And now, as she rounds the corner and as the back of Malfoy's head comes into view, she can't help but feel like something else is about to drastically change the course of her life again.</p>
                <p>Draco must hear her approach, he turns his head toward her slowly. Hermione takes in his face, placid and expressionless, but can't seem to tamper her own expression, which is surely showcasing fear and hesitancy. She stations herself behind the chair on the further side of the room again and waits stiffly for him to speak.</p>
                <p>Theo draws closer, “Hermione is here, she'll hear you out.”</p>
                <p>Draco exhales deeply, “Theo, would you give us a moment?”</p>
                <p>Theo glances at Hermione for confirmation. She nods and he exits the room, leaving the two of them alone.</p>
                <p>Draco slumps his shoulders, releases a labored sigh, and stares off distantly. “I— I apologize. I don't know what came over me.”</p>
                <p>Hermione doesn't reply, but her grip on the back of the chair tightens.</p>
                <p>He continues, “I don't know where I am, let alone how long it's been. I was in shock. I—I didn't mean to startle you…”</p>
                <p>He tips his head down and Hermione takes in his appearance: His hair is long and unkempt, his skin pale and devoid of color, apart from the crimson flush staining his cheekbones, and for heaven's sake, he's still wearing that abominable hospital gown. He's completely out of sorts and looks absolutely pitiful.</p>
                <p>Hermione shuts her eyes and allows her shoulders to relax, she inhales again. One, two. Exhale, One, two, “It's alright Malfoy, it was just a tad traumatizing.” She says finally.</p>
                <p>When she opens her eyes he is staring at her intently, “Don't feel like you have to forgive me.”</p>
                <p>“If you knew me at all, you'd know that that is not possible. I've forgiven you before and…”</p>
                <p>He cuts her off, “I haven't apologized for before.”</p>
                <p>“But that doesn't mean I can't forgive you.” She says, her words slicing through the air, rendering him speechless.</p>
                <p>She means it, she doesn't need an apology, she only wants to move on. To let go of the past, pick up the last morsels of self that she has left, and trudge forward. She doesn't need to carry the heavy weight of what happened at Malfoy Manor with her. She doesn't want to look at it, unpack it, let alone carry it. She only wishes to be rid of it. Hermione rounds the chair and seats herself upon it delicately.</p>
                <p>“Listen, I have no intention of holding anything against you. It was a mistake, I can see how you might have been in shock, we can move on. In all honesty, at the moment, I am the least of your worries.”</p>
                <p>Malfoy tilts his head questioningly, “What do you mean?”</p>
                <p>“Well… It seems your wonderful friend Theodore, sort of —kidnapped you.”</p>
                <p>“Kidnapped me?”</p>
                <p>At that moment, Theodore bursts into the room, “Finally, we've come to the good part.” He says cheerily.</p>
                <p>Hermione emits a glare in his direction. “Technically, right about now, you should be on a train headed for Russia.”</p>
                <p>“Russia?” Malfoy blurts haughtily, “Whatever for?”</p>
                <p>“Well, they planned to Floo you first but Theo and I objected. You see they wanted to send you to Koldovstoretz, it's the Russian—.”</p>
                <p>"I know what Koldovstoretz is. What I want to know is why I am supposed to be sent there."Draco interjects.</p>
                <p>Hermione narrows her eyes at him and grits her teeth. “I was getting there… If you'd just let me continue.”</p>
                <p>“If it's going to take all evening I suppose I'd be better off asking Theodore.” Hermione opens her mouth in offense, but Malfoy only turns to Theodore quirking a brow in question.</p>
                <p>"You were in a coma, nothing helped, and everyone thought the Russians might heal you. I objected, but alas, no one listened. So, I resorted to kidnapping you, shoved a Bezoar in your mouth, and voila, you're awake.”</p>
                <p>Draco simply stares at Theo, then lets his head fall back against the sofa, gazing up at the ceiling in complete disbelief. "It seems you've really fucked things up this time," he remarks.</p>
                <p>“As I do best,” Theo admits remorsefully.</p>
                <p>“And where am I, currently?” He questions the ceiling.</p>
                <p>“You are at my family home, in Hampstead. We're just outside of London.”</p>
                <p>Draco lifts his head from the sofa, “Muggle London?”</p>
                <p>“Well obviously,” Hermione says, rolling her eyes.</p>
                <p>“So what? Am I expected to live here while I try and figure out what the fuck I am supposed to do?”</p>
                <p>Hermione abruptly rises from her seat. “Theodore, I need to speak to you, privately.” She announces.</p>
                <p>Hermione drags Theodore behind her on the march back toward the kitchen. She pushes through the door and shoves him in front of her, planting both feet in the path of the exit, crosses her arms, and gives him her most infuriated look. Her ears are on fire, her head is about to burst with the pressurized rage bubbling and fizzing under her skin.</p>
                <p>“He can't stay,” she asserts firmly.</p>
                <p>Theo deflates; the brightness in his eyes vanishes. “What?”</p>
                <p>“Theodore, Malfoy cannot stay here.” She clarifies.</p>
                <p>“But I told him to apologize, and you two, well, seemed to be getting along…”</p>
                <p>“Well, that was before he and I both remembered the vast potential he has in being an utter arse!” She huffs indignantly and caries on her point, “Besides the fact that I hardly know him, do not trust him, and can hardly stand him, you have to remember that you have yet to ask me— the owner of the house.”</p>
                <p>Theo opens his mouth, likely with that exact question question on his tongue, but Hermione holds up her finger, halting him, “And before you ask, I can already tell you it is a firm, No. Think about it, Theodore…Who is going to take care of him? He's without a wand and practically a toddler when it comes to living in the muggle world. Who is going to teach him how to wash his clothes? Who is going to make his food? Where will he be getting money? Draco Malfoy is in Russia, he doesn't exist here. He has nothing.”</p>
                <p>“He has me.” Theo declares.</p>
                <p>Hermione releases a sardonic laugh, “Hah, Yes! I suppose he does have you! But may I remind you, that you are a student at Hogwarts and cannot simply disappear as you please. They're keeping a close eye on all students who had any ties to Death Eaters, and I'm sorry to say that this does not exclude you.”</p>
                <p>He grimaces, and Hermione feels a tad ashamed at aiming so low. But she can't help it. It is the reality of the situation. Theo consistently allows his blind optimism to lead him toward the cliff's edge, and it is her, who ultimately guides him back to solid ground. Theo straightens, and draws in a deep breath, his hope replaced with resignation. He schools his features and nods.</p>
                <p>“Alright. We'll just be out of your way then. Sorry to bother.”</p>
                <p>Hermione wars with herself. She knows what she's about to do and she hates herself for it. Theo makes to brush past her, but she stops him and presses a firm hand into his shoulder.</p>
                <p>“He can stay. Just for the night.” Her voice is but a mumble.</p>
                <p>Theo immediately cheers and pulls her into a tight hug, all prior resignation gone.</p>
                <p>Holding her securely against him, he murmurs his appreciation, "Thank you. Thank you, Hermione. I'll find him somewhere to go tomorrow."</p>
                <p>“Good.” She replies, and he pulls away. Then suddenly, he plants his palm against his forehead.</p>
                <p>“Agh, wait. I have plans to meet Narcissa tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>Hermione lifts a brow questioning brow, and Theo responds. “It should only take the morning, I should be back by evening.”</p>
                <p>“Alright then. But I have an appointment in town, and I won't be postponing it on account of Malfoy. I'm off to bed. You can take the guest room. It's the first door up the stairs and to the right. He can make do with the sofa... And remember, just for the night.”</p>
                <p>“Just the night,” he repeats.</p>

            <h2>A Dichotomy of Feelings </h2>
            <div>
                <p>She stirs. The sound of rustling sheets fills the room as she works her leg free from the plethora of bondages made of pillows and enough blankets to warm a small village. Finally, leg free, she tosses it over the peak of the newly formed mound and promptly resumes her snoring.</p>

<p>Draco sits— ankle crossed over knee, on the lounge chair in the corner of her room, watching her. He taps his knee. Two, three times.</p>

<p>He's a creep. He knows it. However, at the present moment, he couldn't exactly give a damn.</p>

<p>Finding himself at her bedside was not a simple task; He spent hours on that stiff and uncomfortable sofa, trying to fathom how events culminated to this. It seems Theo has done what Theo always does best, and thoroughly cocked it all up.</p>

<p>Begrudgingly, Draco has come to accept his role in the matter, but truthfully, how could he have known that the potion he pilfered from Theo's bedside table was a mild mixture of Draught of the Living Death? There was even a chance he might have walked away unscathed…If only he hadn't been concussed by the portrait of Professor Snape— the portrait which none other than Theo had tossed out of a window. The ill-timed and horribly mistaken events seem to be connected to his perpetual state of bad luck. All the pieces of this contorted puzzle are finally coming together and starting to make relative, if not ridiculous, sense. All, except her...</p>

<p>Why, of all people, had he heard her? And how had he woken that night? And when he had woken, why was she there? What is she hiding?</p>

<p>However explanations seemed to be off the table last evening, as not two seconds after waking— he promptly attacked her.</p>

<p>Somehow, while he was adrift in the depths of oblivion, Draco began associating Granger with survival, with waking. And so, when he opened his eyes and saw her, he wasted no time with trivialities such as forethought and circumspection. No. He just grabbed her and pinned her to him. It was instinctive; she was tangible, and for a man who spent so long deprived of corporality— she was a lifeline.</p>

<p>So here he finds himself, sitting in the corner of the room, ruminating over events in quiet contemplation; while she snores.</p>

<p>This is a first for him, he's never taken it upon himself to watch someone sleep. Really, it's only fair play. She watched him sleep for weeks, he knew it. He heard her. Felt her...  in any case, he sure as hell can't sleep—won't sleep. In fact, he's dead set on keeping his eyes propped open for the rest of his life. There's no way in hell will he be returning to that place; to the abyss.</p>

<p>So Draco sits back, tapping his knee in thought, as the time trickles by.</p>

<p>When the sun rises, he does so as well, and creeps his way down the stairs. He takes a book from a stack left in the sitting room and reads a bit. Eventually, he makes his way through the house, and wanders aimlessly. He takes the liberty of showering in the downstairs bath, and when he returns to the sofa, discovers a fresh set of clothes and a note:</p>

<p>Gone out. Be back later…Try not to murder our lovely and most generous hostess.</p>

<p>Draco returns to the bath to dress and exits feeling nicely put together. There's clattering coming from the kitchen so makes his way to the door and pushes through quietly. He is promptly met with the sound of music.</p>

<p>It's strange, he's never heard anything like it; the tempo is relaxed and smooth; a combination of instruments he's never heard in concert. He can make out the sound of a horn, possibly a few, a guitar played offbeat— staccato, and several percussive instruments he wouldn't be able to name with a wand held to his throat. The melody is far from the orchestral music he's used too; It's emotive, almost sensual.</p>

<p>He follows it's source and finds Granger, back to him, standing at the counter in a gargantuan muggle shirt, humming to herself while fiddling with a black box. She smacks the side of it a few times, and the volume increases.</p>

<p>Oh, please don't rock my boat.</p>

<p>Hermione joins the background vocals singing, “Don't rock my boat.”</p>

<p>He stands in the doorway, watching as she reaches onto her toes, opens the cupboard at snags a teacup. The kettle whistles.</p>

<p>“I like it like this. I like it like this,” She sings whilst pouring the water into her cup.</p>

<p>He coughs, but it's a useless attempt at gathering her attention, the music is far too loud.</p>

<p>Satisfy my soul… Satisfy my soul…</p>

<p>Hermione sways to the music. “Mmhhmmm,” she hums. Then, she raises her leg and rubs the topside of her foot up and down the back of her calf.</p>

<p>This is obscene, He thinks. And suddenly it's too hot in this bloody kitchen.</p>

<p>Every little action… There's a reaction…</p>

<p>Oh, can't you see? What you've done for me…</p>

<p>“Where's Theo?” He bellows, surprising himself with the forcefulness of his voice.</p>

<p>Hermione seems equally as surprised, as she squeals and jumps back from the counter, causing the tea she had been pouring to upend and spill all over the floor. She turns around wide-eyed, gripping the ledge behind her. The empty cup of tea rolls across the counter, disappearing behind her form, whilst tea trickles onto the floor at her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, it's only you.” She says, her hand going to her heart,  “You startled me.”</p>

<p>She twists back toward the black box and leans down over it, fiddling with the buttons, “I peeked in the sitting room earlier and didn't see you on the sofa. I thought you might left with Theo…” she says over her shoulder, “or might have run off…” she mumbles under her breath.</p>

<p>The volume of the music reduces but continues to play lightly in the background.</p>

<p>Oh, darling, darling, I'm calling, calling…</p>

<p>Runoff? He's of the mind to ask her where exactly she thinks he would go. Most generous host indeed.</p>

<p>When she rounds to face him again, he assesses her appearance; She appears well-rested. Almost too well. Absent are the heavy bags under her eyes, and her complexion is clearer compared to the previous evening, when it had been practically devoid of color. Now, her skin tone is even, with a flush of pink staining the tops of her cheeks.</p>

<p>She's much different than she had been in their younger years; Her teeth are proportional, and less beaver-like—thanks to him. Also, she appears to have grown out of the round face which aligned with her personality as being a cherubic, know-it-all, swot. Her hair, however, remains as it had always been, a mountain of curls. At the moment, she has it propped up atop her head as if its side occupation is to provide sanctuary for transient birds. She even has a twig stuck in it.</p>

<p>Draco scrunches his nose, and gestures to his own head as if to indicate the issue, “Something is stuck,” He says flatly.</p>

<p>“Pardon?” She gives him a strange expression, like he's mad, and begins to slowly side side-step away. To his horror, she completely ignores the puddle underfoot. Her eyes are wide and she regards him like he's completely bonkers, but he's not the one with a twig stuck in his hair, trailing his bare feet through a puddle of tea.</p>

<p>Draco reaches for his wand, intending to vanish the mess, but then recalls that he is without one. He frowns. Draco surveys the surroundings, searching for anything that could be used to wipe the tea. His eyes land on the counter, it's a mess; a stack of books lies disturbingly close to a half-cut orange. However, next to the cutting board, there is a towel— he reaches for it.</p>

<p>Hermione shrieks.</p>

<p>There's a loud bang, and suddenly, he feels like his head is going to implode, or is in the process of imploding. He yelps and collapses onto the floor, gripping the back of it. When he looks up, completely bewildered as to what the fuck just happened, he sees Hermione wielding a metal object like a beater bat.</p>

<p>“What is that?” He questions completely baffled, “And did you just— did you just hit me with it?”</p>

<p>“It's a frying pan. And yes, I did. Keep away from me…” She responds, painstakingly slow.</p>

<p>“What the Fuck, Granger? Why would you do that?”</p>

<p>“You—you were reaching for the knife! You were going to attack me!”</p>

<p>Draco eases onto his feet and follows her gaze as it flits to the counter. Next to the towel, he had been reaching for lay the knife she had been using to slice the oranges.</p>

<p>He balks, “You thought I was going to what?— Stab you?”</p>

<p>“Well, obviously you were! You're only denying it now because you've been caught!” Her voice is shrill.</p>

<p>“I was reaching for the towel!” He shouts.</p>

<p>“Why would you need a dish towel?!”</p>

<p>“It was for you! If you hadn't noticed, you are currently wading in a puddle of tea!”</p>

<p>Hermione looks down at her feet, seemingly just now realizing that she is, in fact, standing in a puddle of tea. Lowering the frying pan, she furrows her brows and gazes down perplexedly.</p>

<p>“But— But you pointed to your head… You said you had something stuck…I thought—Well I thought you might be going ballistic again.”</p>

<p>“Granger, I was gesturing to your head! You have a branch stuck in your hair.” He gestures with his free hand to her hair.</p>

<p>Hermione reaches up and extracts the twig, which upon closer inspection, reveals to be her wand. Her hair, released from its confines, cascades down her shoulders like an avalanche. There is so much of it. He recalls how it had been earlier, spread across her pillows. He can still remember the feel of it from that night several weeks ago. His fingers twitch.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he says, at a loss for words.</p>

<p>It had been her wand this entire time? Why would she keep it in her hair?</p>

<p>She must be reading his mind, “I keep it there in the case of an emergency.” She reasons.</p>

<p>Draco quirks a brow, “Oh, emergencies such as when you're about to be stabbed in your own kitchen?”</p>

<p>“I couldn't think properly!”</p>

<p>“I am unfamiliar with the condition…”</p>

<p>“….I don't even know how I managed to get the pan!”</p>

<p>“It sounds serious…”</p>

<p>“…Something took over… It was reflexive!”</p>

<p>“Your instincts are unparalleled,” he deadpans.</p>

<p>Draco steps back, leans against the counter, and brushes his fingers over the tender area. Although the feeling of imminent imploding seems to have abated, he can feel a mound erupting above his ear.</p>

<p>Hermione sucks in a sharp breath, “Oh, what have I done?”</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, he watches her  Scourgify the tea puddle at her feet. She strides to the auspicious-looking metal cabinet he took notice of earlier while scouring the house. She opens it and tendrils of chilled air rush past her and into the room. Bending over, she shuffles through the barren interior and extracts a white bag with a large label reading Peas.</p>

<p>Draco stands by watching her whilst rubbing his sore head. Whatever she's doing, she moves about it with expert practice.</p>

<p>Draco thinks of his mother, and how she moves with the same determination when finding a pest among her carefully cultivated flowers. Though, only a fleeting moment is spent in thought before he is quickly brought back to the present by the rough tug at the crook of his elbow. He finds himself pulled him from his place at the counter, toward the kitchen table and into a chair.</p>

<p>“Oh Merlin, are you alright? I'm— sorry. Did I just hit you in the head?”</p>

<p>Draco scoffs at the belated apology.</p>

<p>“Yes, it seems to be the target of repeated attacks as of late,” he drawls from his newfound place on the rickety wooden chair.</p>

<p>Hermione doesn't ask. She steps close to his side, takes out her wand, and before he has the chance to react, is performing healing spells on his head. He looks up at her in surprise but she quickly jerks his head to face the wall. She doesn't seem to mind being so close and tends to him as if she has had much experience on the matter.</p>

<p>“Oh, there's a mound! And I clipped your ear!” She gasps, plunging her fingers into his hair, exploring the area as if she's leafing through a shrub at her local park for her lost ball. She's quite rough and far too comfortable at handling him like this. He wants to return to the measured distance and terse bickering from before.</p>

<p>Draco's spine straightens and stiffens, assuming the posture ingrained in him through years of rigid instruction on proper etiquette. He envisions a metal rod tethered to his back, maintaining his spine to the curvature of a lamppost. He tells himself not to look at her, so as not to exacerbate the already indecent situation. Granger, however, appears unfazed. The discomfort associated with close proximity appears to only be felt by him.</p>

<p>“You seem to know what you're doing.” He says, staring at a portrait of rolling hills on the wall.</p>

<p>“I've had quite the practice dealing with wounds, or did you forget I was on the run for a year with none other than Harry and Ronald? The amount of problems those two would get themselves into is remarkable.”</p>

<p>Draco huffs. But doesn't respond.</p>

<p>She uncaps a lid from the array of items she had brought to the table and spoons a glob of something onto it. Honey.</p>

<p>“You see here” She taps a place on his temple, and he winces, “You got this when you were struck with the Portrait of Professor Snape.” She lowers her head examining it, and he can feel her breath on his forehead. Draco twitches away, but she only jerks his head back to her, “It seems to be improving.” She remarks and adds, “Thankfully, I was able to miss that portion. This is honey, mum always said it helps with reducing inflammation.”</p>

<p>Draco attempts to squirm out from her clutch, “Where are your parents? Should I expect them to burst through the door at any second?”</p>

<p>“No, they're away… Out of the country.” She mutters, “Now hold still.”</p>

<p>He feels her apply the honey to his ear, some of it drips down and gets all over his shirt.</p>

<p>“You're getting it all over me,” he grumbles.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry” She takes out her wand, scourgifies his shirt, then pauses, “Where did you get these clothes?”</p>

<p>“They appeared on the sofa when I came out of the shower, along with a note from Theodore. I suspected he had brought them. Not my cup of tea, but I assume it's muggle attire— to blend in.”</p>

<p>She steps back, and scrutinizes him, from the long sleeve cotton white tee—slightly large on him, and the khaki trousers which fit remarkably well, down to the black socks.</p>

<p>“These— these are my dad's!”</p>

<p>“What? Fucking Theo, what a twit!” Draco reaches for the hem and attempts to peel off the shirt.</p>

<p>Hermione yelps, “Stop! What are you doing?”</p>

<p>“I'm returning your father's clothes.”</p>

<p>“I would much rather that you wear my father's clothes than walk around stark naked! We'll have Theo fetch you some later…Just please—for the love of God, keep the clothes on.”</p>

<p>“Fine.”</p>

<p>Hermione goes back to applying the honey across his forehead and he is unable to stop the question from leaving his lips, “You… You're not afraid to touch me then?”</p>

<p>Hermione scoffs, “Why would I be afraid to touch you?”</p>

<p>“Well, you appeared quite terrified all those weeks ago when you collided with me in the corridor.”</p>

<p>“I will not fault you for your poor memory, as you said, your head has been victim to many attacks as of late—but I will enlighten you— you are the one who crashed into me.”</p>

<p>“Are you always this priggish?”</p>

<p>“No. Only with you, it seems you bring out the best in me,” She looks down at him with a derisive smile. Then more seriously, “To your point… I suppose my aversion to touching you has dwindled after having nursed you for weeks… However, I am still not used to you being conscious. That is the strange part…”</p>

<p>“I implore you to never again repeat that phrase. I'd rather not see the Prophet Headline: Hermione Granger nursed Draco Malfoy for weeks… It's disturbing— in every context.”</p>

<p>Hermione swats the back of his sore head and scowls down at him, “You are revolting.”</p>

<p>“The feeling is mutual.” He tries to say it with a straight face, but the corner of his mouth betrays him, freeing half of a smirk. For a fleeting moment, he catches her eyes drift down to the action, then quickly clears her throat, busying herself with recapping the honey.</p>

<p>“So… Why did you help?”</p>

<p>“Why did I help what?” She asks, shoving the package of peas into his hand. She resumes collecting her items from the kitchen table and strides to the cabinets, putting them away.</p>

<p>“When I was…. Concussed, asleep… whatever you want to call it… Why did you help me?”</p>

<p>She pauses while taking a plate from the cupboard, then gently sets it down on the counter. She sighs and speaks with her back toward him, “Theo was a mess. He needed help—helping you. I did what any friend would…”</p>

<p>She retrieves a few items from the metal cabinet and walks over to the stove. Draco scowls down at the table, he's not getting the answers he needs.</p>

<p>“So you were coerced?” He questions.</p>

<p>Granger doesn't deign to give him her attention, instead stands at the stove, and continues to go about her business. The smell of bacon wafts into the air.</p>

<p>“Obviously… Theo twisted my arm, I felt sorry for him. Trust that I never helped of my own volition.”</p>

<p>Liar.</p>

<p>She's lying through her teeth. She had been at his bedside plenty of times without Theo present, without anyone present… He heard her…She spoke to him.</p>

<p>Draco decides to press her, “Did you ever finish your essay on Long-Branch ruins?”</p>

<p>Hermione freezes and slowly turns to face him, “How— how did you know that?”</p>

<p>He sets the bag of peas down on the table and rises, stalking toward her. She steps backward. The bacon sizzles, burning behind her.</p>

<p>“I heard you. I know you were there. Enlighten me— what the fuck did you do to me while I was asleep?”</p>

<p>She gapes at him, stuttering, “I didn't do anything to you Malfoy.”</p>

<p>“Then why is it that I could only hear you? Why were you always there, by yourself? How is it that I woke up that night only to find you there?”</p>

<p>“Malfoy, I— I didn't know you could hear me… I swear…I didn't do anything to you…”</p>

<p>Draco realizes he's crowding her, so he steps back, giving her space. “Don't look at me like that.” He spits.</p>

<p>“Look at you like what?”</p>

<p>“Like you're afraid of me, like you expect that I'm going to attack you at any given moment…. I'm not mad. I've just come out of a coma for Salazar's sake… I'm trying to make sense of it all. I'm confused… And I'm angry…”</p>

<p>“I know… I— I understand or at least, I'm trying to…it's just that yesterday… and the dream…”</p>

<p>“What dream?”</p>

<p>She pushes a lock of hair behind her ear, then folds her arms over her chest and snorts, “I wouldn't say it was a dream. A bit closer to a nightmare if I'm to be honest…”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“You didn't do anything. You were just there, watching over me…While I slept.”</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>He swallows and opts to skirt around, that.</p>

<p>“Would you believe me if I said I truly don't mean you any harm? In fact, at the moment, it seems I am in your debt. I don't know where I would be if it weren't for your help.”</p>

<p>Hermione pauses, then inhales, about to reply, when a ring echoes through the house. She glances toward the kitchen door, “It's the front door. Just— wait here and stay quiet. I'm not expecting any visitors and it's too early for Theo to be back yet. I want to make sure it's not the Ministry.”</p>

<p>She rises and begins padding out of the kitchen barefoot and still in her rumpled sleepwear. Her shirt is four times larger than it ought to be, almost reaching her knees. He isn't even sure if she's wearing any trousers.</p>

<p>“You're not going to answer the door like that are you?” He calls after her.</p>

<p>She looks down at her herself and scoffs, “And why not?”</p>

<p>“Granger you're half-dressed, have some decency, and get some trousers on.”</p>

<p>“There's a spy-hole on the door, I just want to check.”</p>

<p>“Whatever.”</p>

<p>She sends one last glower his way before exiting the kitchen, leaving Draco alone. He takes the pack of frozen peas off the table and presses it to the side of his head. Watermarks seep into the wood where it rested and he rubs his finger over the spot, trying to rid the stain, but it's pointless. Draco huffs, sets the peas back down on the watermark then swiftly rises to his feet and marches out of the kitchen after her.</p>

<p>He waits around the corner and spies Granger standing on her toes, looking through a small hole in the door. She had listened after all and put some trousers on, Draco smirks to himself. She quickly brushes her fingers through her hair and opens the door, revealing a strange man leaning against the frame. He's tall, dressed in black leather attire with chains hanging from every possible square inch of his body. A prisoner? His hair is unkempt, and he's wearing a devilish smirk as his eyes rove over Granger; he's practically devouring her with his gaze.</p>

<p>“Jacob! How are you?” Hermione squeals, pulling him into a hug.</p>

<p>The man imparts a wicked smile and accepts the embrace. Draco watches in disgust as the man's hands venture low on her back. It's revolting, does the man have no sense of propriety? Granger however, not entirely devoid of sensibility, promptly squirms herself free from the embrace. The man furrows his brow, then sweeps his gaze into the house, over the sitting room, and in Draco's direction.</p>

<p>“Shit” Draco swears and silently ducks back into the kitchen. When the door swings shut, he presses his ear against it, listening.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hermione.” He hears Jacob purr. The twat actually purrs her name. Draco rolls his eyes.</p>

<p>“I saw your car parked in the driveway and thought I'd pop in to say hello. It's been a few weeks since I've last seen you… We didn't have the chance to spend more time together that night.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes… Erm—I'm sorry for having left so abruptly that night. It was, a lot…”</p>

<p>“Don't worry, did you have fun at least?”</p>

<p>“I did. You certainly know how to make the most of an evening out.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear… and there's much more I can do to make our next night out worth your while.”</p>

<p>Malfoy scoffs, what a slag.</p>

<p>“I wanted to invite you to my birthday, it's at the end of October,” There's a pause, “I'm a Scorpio, you know.”</p>

<p>Who is this divination fruit-basket?</p>

<p>“Yes. Of course I'll come.”</p>

<p>“Perfect. I'll bring by an invitation… Are you free tonight?”</p>

<p>No, she's not. You daft git.</p>

<p>“Oh… actually, I'm a bit busy this weekend, but maybe come by next?”</p>

<p>“No worries. I suppose I'll leave you to it. Have a good day, Hermione.”</p>

<p>“You too Jacob.”</p>

<p>Draco hears the door click close and he scrambles back to his seat at the table. He holds the peas back up to his head and stares fixedly at the wall. The kitchen door creaks as it swings open, but he doesn't spare her a glance.</p>

<p>“I take it that it wasn't anyone from the ministry?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. It was just a friend.”</p>

<p>“Your muggle boyfriend?” He questions derisively.</p>

<p>He looks to her then, and she grits her teeth, “No. A friend Malfoy…Besides, I don't know see how it would be any of your concern if he was.”</p>

<p>“It's not.” Draco, thinks of Theo, “Is he a “friend” in the same way Theo is just a friend?”</p>

<p>She narrows her eyes, “Yes…. though, not in the same context you might mean when you say he's your friend.” She uses her fingers to quote the word "friend".</p>

<p>Draco scrunches his nose. “What's that supposed to mean?”</p>

<p>“Jacob is a good friend. That's all I'd like to discuss on the matter.” She says in a clipped tone.</p>

<p>“No, clarify what you meant.”</p>

<p>“I—”</p>

<p>Her response is interrupted by a faint tapping. They both turn to the noise and see an owl hovering at the patio door. Hermione pads over, pushes open the French doors, and then takes the note, trading it for a snack for the owl. Draco knows the familiar owl, it's Cacedus.</p>

<p>“It's from Theo.” She says.</p>

<p>“I recognize the owl.”</p>

<p>Hermione unrolls the note and begins reading.</p>

<p>“What does it say?” Draco asks as he attempts to snatch it from her, but she pivots away.</p>

<p>“Theo says he's finished up visiting with your mother and hopes to be by in a few hours.”</p>

<p>“Why did he visit my mother?”</p>

<p>“Look, I've learned not to question Theo. Ninety percent of the time I'd rather not know what he's up to. He's figuring something out for you. Somewhere you can stay…”</p>

<p>“I thought I was staying here.”</p>

<p>“You're not.” It's blunt.</p>

<p>“I'm not going anywhere until I have a wand and a place to go.”</p>

<p>Hermione places a hand on her hip, “Well I apologize Your Majesty, but unfortunately, you don't have a say in the matter. Theo is going to find you a place to stay for the time being until he has all this” she gestures in his direction, “sorted.”</p>

<p>“I don't trust Theo's judgment.”</p>

<p>“Malfoy.” She rubs at her temple roughly, “You can't stay here. I hardly know you, and quite frankly, do not trust you.”</p>

<p>“What? Do you think I'll be tormenting the muggles in the neighborhood? Afraid I'll wandlessly Avada your boyfriend?”</p>

<p>She stares at him blankly. He's of the mind to shake her.</p>

<p>Why would he incite havoc on the muggles? He only wants a place to stay.</p>

<p>“Look, I have to go into town. I have an appointment at noon and I just can't— I can't deal with you at the moment. Will you just, wait for Theo? He should have news on your arrangements.”</p>

<p>“And when will that be?”</p>

<p>She looks down at the note. “He says he'll be back in a few hours.”</p>

<p>“It's quite vague. What does he mean by a few hours?”</p>

<p>“How am I supposed to know?” She cries out in exasperation, thrusting the note into his hand as she moves to walk past him.</p>

<p>“I want to come with you.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>He urges her, “Granger, I have to get out of here. I haven't seen the outside world in over three weeks.”</p>

<p>She wheels around to face him again, “Malfoy, I can't take you.” She grinds out.</p>

<p>“Please” the word leaves his lips before he can think better of it. Reduced to begging it seems.</p>

<p>She glares at him for a few moments, then rolls her eyes, “Fine. But you'll wait in the car.”</p>

<p>“Car?”</p>

<p>She smirks and pads out of the room, “Be ready in an hour,” She calls over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Draco's stomach grumbles, he's about to ask if she has anything to eat, but the kitchen door is already swinging closed. Draco places the pack of peas back down on the table and is surprised to see a plate sitting where the watermarks were.</p>

<p>Orange slices, toast, and bacon.</p>

<p>Draco takes one of the books off the kitchen counter; It's small, and there's a possibility of him finishing it by the time Granger makes her way downstairs. He's been waiting for what seems like hours. He thumbs open the cover and scrawled across the interior, in Granger's handwriting is a quote:</p>

<p>“I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.”</p>

<p>He flips past the introduction and begins reading.</p>

<p>“I'm leaving!”</p>

<p>About time. Draco releases the Black pendant he'd been rolling between his fingers and tucks it back beneath his shirt. His mother must have sent it while he was comatose; he imagines her pleading with Theo to deliver it, extracting promises from him to ensure it reached her beloved son. He snaps shut the book, rises, and tucks it under his arm as he strides out of the kitchen. He finds Granger in the entry room, standing in front of the mirror attempting to wrangle her hair. It's twisted and clipped at the base of her neck, like the French girls at Beauxbatons, except tendrils of hair appear reluctant. Some curls have escaped and flutter aimlessly down the side of her neck. It's messy, but not overly so, he thinks. She has a collection of pins held between her lips and seems to be trying to tame some of the loose strands when her gaze meets his in the reflection, then settles on the book nestled in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p>She turns, one hand still in her hair as she takes the pins from her mouth, “Is that my book?”</p>

<p>“Am I forced to wait in the car, without reading material?” He drawls.</p>

<p>“No, It's fine. I finished it yesterday… Actually, I've read it a few times, it's a muggle classic.”</p>

<p>“A muggle classic about a man being transfigured into an insect?”</p>

<p>“It's a metaphor.”</p>

<p>“I'd like to discover it on my own, thanks.”</p>

<p>She turns back to the mirror, settling the last of the pins in her hair, “You know… your situation is not dissimilar to Gregor's in the story… you see he's—”</p>

<p>He cuts her off, “Thanks Granger but I don't need instructions on how to read. Aren't we going to be late?”</p>

<p>She huffs and eyes the clock, it's a quarter past Eleven. “Oh, drat, is that really the time? C'mon we've better go.”</p>

<p>He follows her out the front door and pauses whilst she locks up the house. Draco breathes in the fresh air and looks around. England appears just as dreadful as ever; the crisp cold air nips at his bare arms and dense grey clouds hover with promises of impending inclement weather. It's going to rain and he's in nothing but her father's raggedy long-sleeved t-shirt and scuffed trainers.</p>

<p>Hermione's boots click on the cobblestone as she makes her way down the path and toward the car.</p>

<p>“Earth to Malfoy! Get a move on!” She calls.</p>

<p>“There's no doorman, I'm afraid you'll have to open it yourself.” She says jeeringly and pulls the lever on her own door.</p>

<p>He follows suit, pulling the handle of the door directly behind hers. As expected, it swings open, revealing scattered books lying carelessly across the seat as well as an upturned bag, its contents strewn across the floor.</p>

<p>He draws back, “Where am I supposed to sit, Granger? Your car is a mess.”</p>

<p>“That was your doing,” She clips.</p>

<p>Draco quirks a brow in question, and she carries on, “Yesterday… Theo shoved you back there with no particular care for any of my things…” she slams the door shut, and gestures to the other side of the car, “You can sit up front. In the passenger seat. Go around.”</p>

<p>The witch is agonizingly bossy, but he's in no position to argue with her; he doesn't want to be left alone in that house. He suppresses the urge to fire back a reply just yet, at least not until they're on the road. He walks around the car, pulls open the door, and attempts to sit down, but the space is so cramped, and his legs are squished.</p>

<p>“Granger, I can't fit.” He grumbles, pulling up his knees.</p>

<p>“Pull the lever under the seat.” She verbally instructs and seats herself.</p>

<p>Draco reaches his hand underneath the seat but only discovers old sweet wrappers and balled-up parchment.</p>

<p>Hermione huffs impatiently and leans her body down over his legs. He jerks in surprise causing his knee to connect with her forehead. She cries out.</p>

<p>“Damn it Malfoy! Sit still!” She yells, gripping her forehead. When she reaches back down between his legs, she must have found the lever because his seat slides smoothly backward.</p>

<p>“There.” She huffs, “Now seatbelt, Just like this.”  He follows her instruction and clicks his belt across his body.</p>

<p>“Alright. Now off we go.”</p>

<p>After a terrifying twenty minutes of driving, followed by another ten spent scoping for parking, Granger abruptly veers the car into a spot. Even after the car comes to a stop and the keys are removed, Draco maintains his white-knuckled grip on the armrest and the car door. Only when he's certain the risk of the car restarting is null, does he release his hold and peer out of the window; there's a myriad of buildings, all squished together, concrete-on-concrete, ad infinitum— in the distance up the street and skywards. The first few droplets of rain he had predicted splatter across the window and trickle down the glass.</p>

<p>Hermione whines, “Oh bother! Of course it rains after I spent all that time doing my hair! Where is that blasted umbrella?” She says, presumably to herself because Draco couldn't really give a damn, she should know this. In any case, that hair was a lost cause from the onset of her birth. She reaches her arm into the backseat and rummages on the floor. In avoidance of yet another invasion of his personal space, he edges closer to the car door.</p>

<p>“Aha!” She cries triumphantly and pulls her arm back, clutching the umbrella. “Alright, my meeting is in the building just down the street, this is the closest spot I could find. I should be about an hour, give or take. If you need to get out for whatever reason, lock the doors like this.” she gestures to flicking a switch on her side of the door, “Otherwise, enjoy the book. Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Then she's stepping out, and slamming the door.</p>

<p>Draco watches as she stands in the rain, attempting to pry open the uncooperative umbrella. He snickers to himself, What a daft bint.</p>

<p>She swears and shakes the umbrella repeatedly, but it's no use. Draco admits that it's quite an entertaining display. Granger glances around and surreptitiously draws her wand from her overcoat, muttering a spell. The umbrella pops open. She pulls it over her head and turns toward him. He sneers and the childish twat sticks out her tongue at him. When he scowls back at her, she's already striding down the street, paying no attention to the suspicious-looking muggles loitering about, smoking, and staring at her arse as she walks past.</p>

<p>Savages. They shouldn't be looking at her like that.</p>

<p>He glances around the car and realizes they seem to be everywhere. She's parked in their den. There are several of them huddled across the street, under a shop canopy. He eyes a particularly ragged-looking one, who appears so poor and wretched that he can't even seem to afford a pair of well-fitting trousers—they sag haphazardly to his knees—Draco curls his lip at him. However, all at once he regrets the action, as the man takes notice, and fails to remove his gaze as he leans into his friend, says something, and nods his chin in Draco's direction. Then suddenly, the entire lot of them are all glaring at him.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>He doesn't have a wand. How is he going to defend himself against a gang of rabid Muggles?</p>

<p>Hastily, he unbuckles his seat and opens the door, locking it the way Granger had instructed. When he peeks a glance up over the car, they're already crossing the street, walking toward him. He doesn't have time to think, he bursts into a sprint. Rain pummels into him as he flies down the pavement, making it hard to see, to breathe. He crosses the street, swerving around cars, they honk and screech to a stop. He looks over his shoulder to check if they're still following  and nearly misses being hit by a bus. He dives onto the pavement and collides with a makeshift newsstand.</p>

<p>“Oi!” The tender yells, “Pull your 'ead outta yer mum's minge and watch where ya bloody goin!”</p>

<p>The commotion catches the eye of several passersby, including the notice of the man with the saggy trousers. He whistles, signaling to his mates, and they all break into a sprint toward him. Draco scrambles to his feet and flees. His heart is pounding in his chest as he frantically scours the streets looking for where Granger had gone. He catches sight of a frizzy up-do, she's a couple of blocks ahead, pulling open the glass door to a building.</p>

<p>He picks up speed, racing toward her but is suddenly hauled backward by the hem of his shirt. When he looks over his shoulder, he finds one of the brutes has a firm hold on the back of it. It's instinctive— he utters a wandless Relashio, and an Impedimenta.</p>

<p>At once, the man's hold loosens, and he comes to a sudden stop. Draco doesn't glance back until he reaches the entrance to the building, and when he does, he finds the man still rooted to the spot, the rest of the gang clustered around him, looking equal parts bewildered and furious.</p>

<p>Draco steps inside the building, swings the door shut, and leans against it, panting. He's absolutely soaked through— his shirt clinging to him, practically transparent, and slightly torn at the back, but he's not cold, he's on fire because he can't fucking breathe.</p>

<p>“Oh! Good Lord! Sir, are you alright?” Draco looks up and discovers a petite elderly woman sitting behind a receptionist's desk, gaping at him.</p>

<p>“Afternoon.” Draco grunts, and sends an awkward wave, “I— Erm. Yes, apologies. Have you by any chance seen a woman, shorter-ish— well, compared to myself…Brown hair, frizzy. Umbrella?” He takes in another gasp of air, attempting to collect himself. Then gives up entirely and crumples against the door, brining his palms to his eyes.</p>

<p>Breathe, Breathe, Draco, he tells himself. He tries his best to occlude but he's so badly shaken.</p>

<p>He hears the woman stuttering, “I—well… I am not sure I can discuss the identity of Mr. Pelcorn's client's with—Pardon, What was your name?”</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>He releases a sigh of relief upon hearing her voice and lifts his gaze to see her striding towards him. She could be an angel--An obviously incensed one, and he's never felt more relieved to see her. She narrows her eyes at him, there's a glint of something fiery there—  though this lasts but a millisecond before she's regarding the receptionist and fabricating a smile the sweetness of a deranged diabolical puppy. When she reaches him, she murmurs a curt “Pardon” to the woman before hauling him around the corner and behind a partition of potted plants.</p>

<p>“You are drenched! And what happened to your shirt?” She hisses, poking him in the chest, “I told you to wait in the car! How difficult could it be to listen?”</p>

<p>He heaves a breath, a big one, “First of all, I don't know who you think you are, I do not take orders from you. Secondly, there were muggles everywhere! The lowly sort, I was practically defenseless…”</p>

<p>She gasps, smacks him in the arm, and cries out in a hushed tone, “The lowly sort?!”</p>

<p>Draco bats her away, “Yes! With holes, rips, and tears and…and chains, all over them!” He gestures his hand up and down his body attempting to help her comprehend the gravity of the situation. “Their clothes and trousers falling to their knees! They were crawling out from crevices as you walked down the street like— like cockroaches!”</p>

<p>Her mouth drops open in shock, “Cockroaches! Malfoy, how dare you!” she exclaims, then swiftly launches a volley of attacks on his chest and arms.</p>

<p>“Ow! You batty witch, calm down,” He hisses, swatting away her hand as if warding off a swarm of blood-thirsty mosquitoes. Her assault is relentless, forcing him to take both her wrists in his hand, cuffing them. He leans down, trying to get her to stop squirming, and whispers urgently, “I had to get away, if you would just calm down and listen to me—”</p>

<p>“Ms. Granger!”</p>

<p>They both glance up to see a pot-bellied man and the petite receptionist regarding them with identical looks of concern.</p>

<p>“Pardon, but is there a problem, Ms. Granger? Do I need to call someone..?” The man asks, casting a mistrustful look in Draco's direction, then down at the firm grip he has around Hermione's wrists.</p>

<p>Draco follows the man's gaze, down to his hands locked around Granger's wrists. His knuckles are white from the tight grip; he can feel her pulse thundering rapidly under his thumb.</p>

<p>Fuck.</p>

<p>He loosens his hold, but doesn't completely let her go. He needs to think…</p>

<p>If they toss him from the building, three things are likely to happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>The thugs could catch him, and possibly kill him.</li>
<li>A bystander might identify him and call the muggle authorities to have him arrested, leaving the thugs enough time to find him and kill him.</li>
<li>Worse yet, the Aurors might be on the street, given that he's just cast magic on a muggle, and will undoubtedly throw him into Azkaban, where there is a high probability he might be killed by wizard thugs or dementors…Or even worse, by his own father, who moved by pity for the Malfoy name, may choose to put him down himself.</li>
</ol>

<p>He cannot fathom accepting any of these scenarios as viable options. He'd go down as a pathetic imbecile in both Wizarding society, as well as the muggle one. His mind flits through possible alternatives, which as of late, remain invariably few. He chooses one, his least favorite, but he's a Slytherin— always has been; he's resourceful, ambitious, charming, determined, clever, and above all, a survivalist. Draco drops to one knee.</p>

<p>When he brings her hands to his mouth, Hermione's eyes grow wide in fear.</p>

<p>When he places a soft kiss on her knuckles, her expression grows horrified.</p>

<p>And when he looks into her eyes and says, “‘I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself…' You are the love of my life, You—‘you satisfy my soul', Marry me…” All expressions and color—vanish.</p>

<p>There's a gasp, followed by an, “Oh dear”.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, Draco glimpses the elderly receptionist clutching at her chest, a dreamy-like haze in her eyes, while Mr. Pelcorn stands stalk still, mouth agape.</p>

<p>He centres his attention back on Granger, but her eyes are glossed over as she stares dazedly at their conjoined hands. She remains like this— still and motionless, for several moments, as if struck by a Petrificus Totalus.</p>

<p>Draco squeezes her hand once, then twice. Slowly, she lifts her gaze from their intertwined hands and traces a path up his chest and neck, until her brown eyes lock with his. She maintains her composure, revealing nothing— even as his own eyes silently plead with her.</p>

<p>She releases her hands from his and cups his cheeks, Draco sighs in relief, but something flares beyond her gaze—he's miscalculated…All too suddenly, a stinging pain travels up his cheeks and sears the sides of his face. Draco, however, is resolute and doesn't flinch away; he only keeps his gaze locked on hers as he winces and gasps. Her eyes dance.</p>

<p>Sadistic Witch.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ms. Granger, can't you see the poor man is in misery!” The receptionist pleads.</p>

<p>“Misery, is indeed what I'm in...” Draco chokes out, he thinks he might black out soon, “Please, darling…have mercy on a poor man.”</p>

<p>She grins menacingly down at him and brushes her thumb over his cheek, sending more stings in its wake.</p>

<p>“Darling…” she coos whilst sliding the backs of her fingers excruciatingly slow, up and down the side of his face, peppering tiny stings in their wake.</p>

<p>“Yes?” He forces the word through clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Her eyes flit between his own which are currently pleading for dear life.</p>

<p>“I'm truly at a loss for words… Might we discuss this later, in private? At home?” She says, finally.</p>

<p>“Anything you say, dear.” He gasps.</p>

<p>She smiles sweetly down at him and then pulls her hand away. Draco steels himself and squeezes his eyes shut, willing his body not to collapse. Slowly, he stands up on shaky legs.</p>

<p>A wail pierces the air and they both turn toward the receptionist who is sobbing into a handkerchief mumbling, “I've never seen anything so romantic! Your love is so beautiful, such a beautiful couple you are. Ohhh!”</p>

<p>“Gladdis, my dear, please compose yourself and fetch the champagne from the cellar; Congratulations are in order!” He exclaims.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelcorn side-steps next to Granger and drapes his arm over her shoulder, squeezing her in an awkward hug, “Ms. Granger, so happy to hear about the engagement, your parents would be so proud.” His pudgy hand continues to clutch the side of her arm, patting it; Granger looks like she'd rather be Crucioed. He pats her head, proclaiming jovially, “I've known Ms. Granger for many years since she was a wee runt! Isn't that right Ms. Granger?” He nudges her and she nods, her body squished into his side, her lips a thin line. “The name is Jeffrey Pelcorn, pleased to meet your acquaintance.” He says, finally releasing Granger and offering his hand.</p>

<p>Draco eyes it warily before accepting, “A pleasure indeed,” he responds.</p>

<p>“You must be feeling like the luckiest bloke in town about now! What's your name, son?”</p>

<p>Hermione opens her mouth to respond but Draco cuts her off and steps forward. “Derek Malfoid, pleased to meet your acquaintance.” He says, giving a terse nod of his head.</p>

<p>Draco doesn't dare look in the direction of the eyes currently drilling holes into the side of his head.</p>

<p>“Malfoid… hmmm.. the surname is quite rare, is it not? Is your family from here in London?” Mr. Pelcorn inquires.</p>

<p>“No, I'm afraid not. My family resides in Wiltshire.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pelcorn rubs at his chin, “Malfoid of Wiltshire…. My, my… might you happen to have any relation to Lucas Malfoid?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he was my father.”</p>

<p>“You— Your father is Lord Lucas Malfoid of Malfoid Exports and Logistics?” He says, eyes wide.</p>

<p>“Yes. Well… late father.” Draco admits.</p>

<p>“ I'm sorry to hear... well… what a fascinating turn of events! I must admit, I woke this morning with the expectation of a rather mundane morning here at the office, little did I expect that I'd be witness to an engagement to the daughter of one of my most longstanding clients— And to a Lord, no less! Gladdis! Did you hear that? He's a Lord, of Wiltshire!”</p>

<p>Gladdis not present, but listening in, calls out in reply, “I heard, Dear! What a pleasant surprise!”</p>

<p>“A pleasant surprise indeed! Delightful!” Mr. Pelcorn declares, shaking his head while gazing at Draco with a distant twinkle in his eyes, “Lord of Wiltshire, in my very own office”, he trails off.</p>

<p>“Mr. Pelcorn, might we suggest the matters at hand,” Hermione grits out.</p>

<p>“My apologies. Yes, certainly. Ms. Granger and Mr. Malfoid, please follow me to my office.” Mr. Pelcorn strides across the small space of the waiting room, “Or might I say future Mr. And Mrs. Malfoid? Oh, what a surprise!”</p>

<p>Draco fixes his gaze on Mr. Pelcorn's form and follows after him, he does not—does not peek a glance at Hermione. He doesn't acknowledge the slight shift in the air, as it the particles of oxygen have been sucked from the room. When he reaches the office, he has the sudden urge to close the door behind him and shut her out entirely, but she's already making her way into the room. He considers his options and decides it would be best if he were to just— leave. He turns around swiftly with the intent to walk back out the door.</p>

<p>“Mr. Malfoid!” Mr. Pelcorn calls, “Where are you off to, son?”</p>

<p>“Suddenly, I've found I'm not feeling quite well. I think it would be best if I were to wait in the reception lounge.” He responds, evading Mr. Pelcorn's beady eyes.</p>

<p>Gladdis's small head appears from behind the cracked door, “No champagne? Goodness, me but I went through all that trouble of washing the glasses! ” She announces in a rather snappish tone.</p>

<p>Draco grits his teeth and finds the courage to peek at that glance which, up until now, he has avoided so diligently. Hermione is seated in a leather back chair, staring abstractedly at the floor, her brows furrowed.</p>

<p>“I suppose… I could stay… if that—if that's what you would like…” Draco directs this to her, but his eyes are trained on Mr. Pelcorn's desk.</p>

<p>Hermione looks up at him. He flits his gaze toward her and reads her expression, what I would like is for you to jump off the side of a cliff, but she only nods, mumbling, “Yes, it's fine.”</p>

<p>“Wonderful!” Mr. Pelcorn trumpets.</p>

<p>Draco strides to the seat to Granger's left and seats himself stiffly. Gladdis comes around offering flutes to all parties. The champagne is nursed in poignant silence. Draco struggles to repress an involuntary recoil upon sampling his flute; the wine is warm and far too sweet.</p>

<p>He places the flute delicately upon a coaster on the table beside him, ensuring it's centered and angled just so. Sensing eyes upon him, he turns his head to find Granger observing him contemptuously. She huffs, pivots in her seat, sets down her glass, considerably less delicately, and clasps her hands over her knee.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but Mr. Pelcorn, Might we proceed with the business at hand?”</p>

<p>“Yes, very good. Let me gather my paperwork.” Mr. Pelcorns shuffles a few items on his desk, then finally seems to find what he's been looking for and clears his throat, “Oh here we are. Yes, that's the one.” He feigns reading from a manilla folder, then sighs, “Oh dear, it truly pains me to say this, but unfortunately, the house... well, the bank has been very patient, you see, but given the lack of payments…. the house— well it must be sold..”</p>

<p>Granger's spine stiffens. “Pardon?"</p>

<p>“The house is to be placed on the market.” He clarifies unequivocally.</p>

<p>“My— my home? Sold?” she stutters.</p>

<p>“It's deeply troubling, I understand that… But you see the bank and the courts have issued several notices, you must understand that payments cannot be deferred indefinitely…”</p>

<p>“But— but how? But I wrote to them. I informed them I was away— at school…”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I'm aware of that fact…However, regardless of whether you are in school, the mortgage is still required at the beginning of each month… The council was very generous in initially delaying the payments for eight months after your parents were declared missing. And if you recall from our previous meeting, you were also quite difficult to reach during that time…”</p>

<p>“Because I've been studying abroad! I'm not present! How am expected I to make the payments while still in school?” She questions in disbelief.</p>

<p>“Miss Granger, it has been over a year since your parents' disappearance. In my role as your solicitor, I've been working diligently on your behalf to honor your wishes to keep the home. We've liquidated the remaining assets to settle the debts, cover legal fees, pay council taxes, and catch up on overdue mortgage payments. However, despite our best efforts, we've reached an impasse… Unfortunately, the remaining assets are insufficient to sustain the property, and without action, the bank could very well force repossession. It is my duty to preserve as much remaining capital for you as is possible— until the probate proceedings can begin.”</p>

<p>“But— but I'm a beneficiary.” She argues.</p>

<p>“Your parents are missing, not presumed dead. We're still in a waiting period. Missing person cases like these must remain open for at least a year before assets can be distributed to beneficiaries, and in some cases, even up to seven. If there were proof of death, things could move along much more swiftly, otherwise, we must think long-term and consider how we could best preserve your holdings.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pelcorn folds his hands together and gives her a sympathetic look. Granger's eyes alone could Avada the man.</p>

<p>Draco, for inexplicable reasons, takes it upon himself to intervene, ”Excuse me, Mr. Pelcorn, but if I may, it remains in my interest to ensure that the property is maintained under Miss Granger's care. What might be necessary to guarantee this?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Malfoy, considering your impending nuptials, Ms. Granger may only require evidence of access to financial support sufficient enough to cover outstanding debts and taxes… If this were the case, I fail to see why there would be an issue until the probate period ends and the home can be released into her care.”</p>

<p>Draco glances side-long at Granger. Her gaze is rooted to the floor again, “Right. We will see about this then.” Draco says.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelcorn claps his hands, “Splendid. Oh my, look at the time. I apologize, but my next meeting is in a few minutes. Ms. Granger, if I could just have you sign these papers… Given Mr. Malfoid's financial standing, we should be able to work something out.” Mr. Pelcorn says assuringly.</p>

<p>They conclude their business and walk in relative silence out of the office. Draco seems to be a man of incomprehensible action— he places a hesitant hand on the small of her back and guides her through the waiting room. They impart their farewells to Mr. Pelcorn and Gladdis. Granger doesn't spare him a glance as they exit the building.</p>

<p>They walk a short distance, and Draco removes his hand from her back. Suddenly, she whirls on him, gripping the front of his shirt. Before he can react, he feels a sharp tug on his navel as he's pulled into the most violent apparition he's ever experienced. When they land in the dingy alleyway, he doesn't have time before she's on him, shoving him against the wall, the stone digging into his back.</p>

<p>“I'm of the mind to murder you right here Malfoy! What the fuck was that!?” She hisses. And shoves her wand into the tender skin of his throat. The rain pelts down on them like hexes. Steam rolls off her face and hair from her fury.</p>

<p>“I— I had no choice they thought I was harassing you! They were moments away from calling the police— And I couldn't leave—the muggles were after me, I hexed one and the Aurors—.”</p>

<p>“Aurors?? Malfoy are you mad? What muggle?! What did you do?! How could I think for a moment I could trust you!”</p>

<p>She whips her arm upward casting a impervius charm above them, halting the rain. Moist, hot hair expands within their isolated bubble, it's suffocating. She forces her wand further into his throat, and it's completely overwhelming and difficult to breathe.</p>

<p>“Why, why Is it always me? Why couldn't you just sit there and stay put? How dare you use Kafka!” She shrieks, “Bob Marley! To— to fabricate a pitifully charming and perversely unwarranted proposal!” She smacks him with her free arm, “And— and I didn't even say yes! You all just went along with it!” She sends another stinging hex into his throat, making him jolt, his head collides roughly with brick, leaving him breathless and gasping.</p>

<p>She does it again and he yelps, “Fuck! Stop! Granger!” Then she's using her fists, pounding his chest.</p>

<p>She's completely lost it.</p>

<p>“And what was that? Derek Malfoid? You're either a horrible liar, you confounded the man and his wife, or your entire family are fucking hypocrites!”</p>

<p>Draco flinches under the assault, “It's the latter!” She pauses, “They—My family has always maintained enterprise in the muggle world because— money, of course. The business was transferred to my name after my father's untimely “death”.”</p>

<p>Her eyes are wild with outrage; She looks rabid. Draco considers that she may actually try and bite him. She beats him with increased intensity, “You greedy, spoilt, narcissistic, manipulative—”</p>

<p>“Give 'em a proper go, lass. Oi, 'owd ya stop the rain? Send it o'er 'ere, eh?”</p>

<p>They both whip their heads in the direction of the voice. Not two meters away, huddling under a makeshift tent formed between the brick and the opened lid of a dumpster, crouches a muggle man, watching them. Hermione gasps and rears backward, “I—I just used magic. I cast an Impervus charm and I hexed you, in front of him!”</p>

<p>“Magic, eh?” The man says, eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>“Granger…” Draco breathes.</p>

<p>She flicks wide eyes toward him, “I—No. No. I can't…”</p>

<p>“You have to, you have no choice, it is your duty— as a witch. Either obliviate him or call the Auorors… However, I'd rather not find myself in Azkaban at the moment, particularly given that I've only just  finished concocting a phony proposal to avoid such a fate.”</p>

<p>“No. No, I— I can't Malfoy,” She attempts to tear her hands free from his shirt, his grips if firm around her wrist.</p>

<p>“You can! You've been hexing me all morning, don't tell me that Hermione Granger, swot of the century, doesn't know how to cast a simple memory charm on a muggle.”</p>

<p>“what's all this then? What's a Memory charm?” His eyes widen in comprehension, and he scrambles to his feet.</p>

<p>“Granger…” Draco growls, tightening his hand around her wrist, urging her.</p>

<p>She pulls away, shaking her head, and steps toward the man, her hands raised placatingly.</p>

<p>He yelps, “Keep back! Or I'll call fer ‘elp… ‘Elp!”</p>

<p>Then suddenly, he's turning, about to scamper.</p>

<p>The witch doesn't move, but Draco does. He snatches the wand out of her hand, points it at the man's back, and whispers, “Obliviate.”</p>

<p>The man freezes. Rain continues pouring down over him in waves, blurring his form. Draco steps forward and arcs the wand to the left, “Confundus.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man reanimates and saunters out of the alley, heading off in no particular direction.</p>

<p>Draco stares after him, motionless and silent. Water droplets plink and clatter on the interior of the open dumpster, and the scent of petrichor wafts into the air. Beads of water drip down his forearm, collecting into rivers that branch out over his hand and converge at the wand in his grip. They slide over the curve of the wood before they reach the tip and cascade to the concrete earth. He peers down at the wand. It's Aunt Bella's; the same wand which he'd been subject to many torments by.</p>

<p>It obeyed him.</p>

<p>Draco stares down at the wand for another fleeting second, and then Granger's on him again, pummeling her fists into his chest, “How dare you! You—you ruined his life! Do you even know the meaning of that spell? Of what it can do?!”</p>

<p>All of a sudden, she's no longer hitting him, but balling his damp shirt tightly in her fists. She thrusts her face against him and breaks into a sob.</p>

<p>“That spell! It's— It's…I used it... On them…All my fault… And now… all I have left…And it's going to be taken away!… My— my home…Gone… They— they're gone….fault…everything! Everything—taken away.., I have n—nothing. I—I am nothing…only want to feel.. nothing… Too much… all too much…”</p>

<p>Draco hovers his arms over her head, patting her gently. He doesn't know what to do. He thinks of his mother, rubbing gentle circles into his back when he was a boy, so he does this to her—she collapses further into him, her body wracking from the force of her sobs.</p>

<p>“I— I can't go on like this. It's—it's all— everything— too much. Everyone— dead. It's—dead. I —sh— I should be dead…”</p>

<p>At that, Draco abruptly stops and peels her face from his chest. Her eyes are red and swollen, her hair sticks to her forehead and cheeks, her nose is running. He wipes her face with his shirt and then grips the side of her face, staring intently into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Never say that. Don't dare ever say. You, of all people, deserve to live. Everything everyone on your side fought and died for, was so that you—people like you—could have a chance. Don't you dare desecrate their cause, their lives… You lived because you were loved, and I — I'll admit that I resented you for that. I resented that they loved you— that they chose you, the strange and bizarre muggle-born over a pure wizard, like me. But I don't— I don't believe any of that anymore… I'm not that person. But you— you, of all people, deserve to live. You have the right, far more than I ever have, or ever will…”</p>

<p>He sighs heavily. The ceaseless rain does nothing to drown the overwhelming silence. She has the eyes of a doe, brown and wide. Curls of hair, having escaped her plait—lie flat against the side of her neck. Drops of water pool in her lashes and fall to the freckles peppering her nose and cheeks. Her lips are parted.</p>

<p>Draco scowls down at her, “I don't know who you are, but the Granger I know is a formidable witch. The insufferable swot I grew up alongside was an Abraxan: she bore her passions on her back and trampled all those who dared challenge her marks. She was a Thunderbird: shifting the winds, infiltrating minds with her acumen and charisma, bending them toward logic and reason. She was a Dragon when she chose to be; when challenges arose, she stood before them: recalcitrant, tenacious, dauntless. She was a fearsome thing; she knew it— and she reveled in it. Everyone did. And I have no intention of allowing that uptight, sanctimonious, no-good-for-her-own-bloody-brain, reckless, ballsy bookworm to forget it.”</p>

<p>He grips her shoulders, giving her a good shake, “You are Hermione FUCKING Granger. Now shut up and get a grip!”</p>

<p>Her eyes flare. She bites her lip.</p>

<p>Draco shivers when her cold fingers graze up the side of his neck…</p>

<p>His chest grows warm when she presses her body against his…</p>

<p>When her molten lips meet his own, he entirely skips the process of melting; he vaporizes. It's sublime.</p>

<p>She palms his jaw. His instincts tell him to halt, so naturally, he disregards them and opens for her. She sweeps her tongue in tasting, biting. She's frenzied, greedy; he allows her to take what she wants. He's an offering and she's an untamed, wild thing.</p>

<p>She moves closer and Draco collides with the brick wall, pulling her to him. She scrapes her fingernails over his scalp and grips his wet hair. Draco wraps his arm around her hips and drifts his hands up her spine until he finds what he's looking for. He unclasps the clip and frees her hair. He combs his hands through the curls, assisting them— guiding them as they tumble down to their rightful place across her back. When she arches into him, he's powerless to bite back the groan he releases into her mouth.</p>

<p>Everything is molten now. Hands are everywhere: in his hair, on his neck, all over his chest. It's not real, it can't be. Neither of them seem capable of stopping. He won't and she hasn't, so they must be of the same mind.</p>

<p>If they keep kissing, keep grabbing at one another, if neither of them acknowledge it— then it's not really happening, right?</p>

<p>She's clawing at him, practically climbing him. He palms the back of her knee, and lifts her leg, attaching it to his hip. She gasps. Holding her leg firmly in place, he whips them around, pinning her to the wall, and shoves her against it, crowding her. She gasps again, but this time from the pain of brick biting into her back. He thinks, See, it fucking hurts. But then he's repentant, and breaks from her lips, trailing sweet sorry's down her neck. She arches into him and raises her arms on the brick above. He pins her hands with his free one and looks down at her.</p>

<p>She's fucking—Draco doesn't want to think about how good, how gorgeous— how incredibly wrong this all is. How right. A dichotomy of feelings… She's supposed to despise him, he's Draco fucking Malfoy. And he's supposed to hate her, she's Hermione fucking Granger. She's Hermione fucking Granger…He's feeling a lot of things; none of which, make any sense. It's all wrong, it's too right. He feels a pulse on his neck where the Black pendant rests against his skin. He finds her lips again, ravishing her.</p>

<p>“The source of the magic had originated from somewhere in this area… An obliviation spell was cast on a muggle, followed shortly after by a confundus..”</p>

<p>They rip their lips apart.</p>

<p>“Does it seem to be related to the jinx performed on that other muggle? That was only a few blocks away…”</p>

<p>Granger ducks and pulls him down with her, they crouch and hide behind the dumpster.</p>

<p>“Harry Potter, do not descend into the rabbit hole of false correlation! How many times do I have to remind you of your duties as Junior Auror? What is our purpose here?”</p>

<p>“We're investigating for evidence.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, simple! Now do your duty and let the Head Aurors do theirs. Now, sweep the alley across the street, then this one.”</p>

<p>“Yes sir.”</p>

<p>Draco meets Granger's eyes. They don't contain the frenzied heat he'd seen a few moments ago; now, they are wide and terrified. He scoops Bellatrix's wand off the wet concrete and shoves it her way.</p>

<p>“Apparate us out. Now.”</p>

<p>She nods and takes his hand. They appear in front of the car and she scrambles her hands into her pockets, pulling out the keys. He slides over the front of the car, to the other side, and yanks open the door, ducking in. It's a matter of moments before the engine is running and Granger's peeling the car out of the parking spot, whipping it into a sharp turn. Then, they're speeding off. The air in the car is stuffy from their labored breaths. Steam rolls off from the both of them, condensing onto the windows. They don't speak. They don't look at each other.</p>

<p>When they reach her home, she pulls into the driveway slowly. Even after the engine sputters to a stop, they fail to move. Her knuckles are white where they grip the steering wheel.</p>

<p>She sucks in a sharp breath, “That…it never.”</p>

<p>“Never,” he says flatly, gazing fixedly out the front window.</p>

<p>“Couldn't of.”</p>

<p>“Would never..” He reasons, then looks to her and glances down at her lips, just to confirm it actually happened, because she's confusing and he's not so sure.</p>

<p>They're red. It happened.</p>

<p>“Won't ever—” she continues.</p>

<p>Still staring at her lips he cuts in, “…Improbable.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grow wide.</p>

<p>“Impossible! I meant impossible.” he corrects.</p>

<p>She sighs in relief, “I'm glad we agree.”</p>

<p>They move from the car like mourners in a silent vigil. He waits a few moments, giving her ample walking space, because—crowding. They reach the front door and Draco stares down at her shaking hands whilst she attempts to find the correct key. There are only two on the ring.</p>

<p>“Got it.” She declares and then they're waiting again as she tries to fiddle the key into the lock. Her hand jerks to and fro, missing the mark. Impatience takes its toll, he reaches out and stabilizes her hand with his. She halts and stares down at his hand on her own. But suddenly, without their doing, the lock clicks and the door swings open. Then, Theo is there, regarding them. His eyes drift over their wet attire and hair, and then down to their clasped hands, where they hover in midair. Draco rips his away.</p>

<p>“Ah! My two favorite people in the world! Now tell me, what have you two lovebirds been up to?” He questions in jest.</p>

<p>Oh, Theodore...if you only knew.</p>
